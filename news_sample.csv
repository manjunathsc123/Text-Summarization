0,"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The head of China's quality watchdog is reported to have resigned over the tainted baby milk scandal that has killed four children and sickened nearly 53,000 others.

The official Xinhua News Agency said Li Changjiang had quit with the approval of China's State Council. Li's agency is responsible for ensuring that China's food supply chain is safe.

Monday's resignation came hours after the World Health Organization said the scandal had highlighted flaws in the country's entire food supply chain.

The chemical melamine blamed for causing kidney stones and kidney failure has been detected in formula milk powder from 22 dairies across China.

The crisis was initially thought to have been confined to baby milk powder, but tests have found melamine in samples of liquid milk taken from China's two largest dairy producers, Mengniu Dairy Group and Yili Industrial Group, as well as Shanghai-based Bright Dairy.

WHO China representative Hans Troedsson said on Monday quality issues could occur anywhere from the farm to the retail outlet.

He said ""it's clearly something that is not acceptable and needs to be rectified and corrected,"" according to The Associated Press. Troedsson said the WHO was discussing with officials how to strengthen China's food quality system.

Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has called milk manufacturers ""heartless"" and promised stricter laws to protect the public.

China's Health Ministry said Sunday that about 13,000 children were hospitalized, while another 40,000 had undergone outpatient treatment for illnesses related to suspected melamine-tainted milk products.

The scandal has spread beyond the mainland with melamine being found in three Chinese-made dairy products in Singapore.

The country's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority said tests on ""White Rabbit Creamy Candy"" showed that it was contaminated with melamine and it ordered stores to remove the product from shelves.

Taiwan announced Monday it was banning the importation of all dairy products from China because of melamine contamination in milk supplies on the mainland, Taiwan's Health Ministry said Monday.

And a second child in Hong Kong has been diagnosed with a kidney stones after drinking the tainted milk as worried parents continued to take their children for health checkups, the government said Monday, AP reported.

The 4-year-old boy was in hospital in a stable condition, the Hong Kong government said in a statement. A three-year-old girl was sickened by a suspected melamine-tainted milk over the weekend -- the first known illness outside of mainland China.

The Chinese premier visited Beijing hospitals and a supermarket Sunday to show his concern for the crisis.

""What we need to do now is to ensure that nothing like this happens in the future, not only in dairy products, but in all foods,"" he said. ""Manufacturers and owners of dairy companies should show more morality and social responsibility in these cases. They are heartless, so we have to create strict law and legislation. I'm sorry.""

Investigators arrested two brothers who sold milk used to produce the contaminated baby milk powder last week. They could face death if convicted, according to China Daily, a state-run newspaper.

The raw milk had been watered down and the chemical added to fool quality checks, the newspaper said. Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants.  Watch CNN visit the company at the center of the scandal »

But anger has been directed not just at the producers accused of adulterating their milk to increase profits, but also at government regulators, Time magazine reported.

""Xinhua was quick to blame the dairy industry for their skewed rules, but what it didn't say was that the government also played a part in that ugly game,"" the magazine quoted a blogger, identified as sadmoon109, as saying.

Health experts say ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones, urinary tract ulcers, and eye and skin irritation. It also robs infants of much-needed nutrition.

Thousands of tons of the tainted milk powder have been recalled.

Melamine is the same industrial contaminant from China that poisoned and killed thousands of U.S. dogs and cats last year.

The chemical, a byproduct of plastic manufacturing, can be used to mimic high-protein additives.  Learn more about the chemical melamine »

A senior dairy analyst said Chinese farmers were cutting corners to cope with rising costs for feed and labor.

""Before the melamine incident, I know they could have been adding organic stuff, say animal urine or skin,"" Chen Lianfang of Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultant told Time.

""Basically, anything that can boost the protein reading.""

1,"Clarksburg, West Virginia (CNN)  -- North Central West Virginia Airport boasts quick check-ins, free, accessible parking and a convenient baggage claim.

That's not surprising, considering that fewer than 20 people fly out of the facility on any given day. And all three scheduled daily departures to Washington have a stop in Morgantown, West Virginia, only 35 miles away. But the airport offers a special treat as the end of the year approaches -- free sightseeing flights.

Thanks to a Federal Aviation Administration program that gives small regional airports millions of dollars if they can reach a certain level of passenger traffic, the Clarksburg, West Virginia, facility tries its best to get 10,000 passengers off the ground by the end of the year. For Suzanne Pierson, that meant she and her grandson Donavan got an ""awesome"" bird's-eye view of Clarksburg and neighboring Bridgeport, West Virginia, from a chartered Boeing 757 last December.

""They were trying to meet the quota, and they were 300 passengers short,"" said Pierson, who saw an ad placed by the airport advertising the free flights.

Since the difference between 10,000 and 9,999 is the difference between $1 million and $150,000 in federal funds, airport managers in Clarksburg and other small towns do whatever they can to get over that number. In Kearney, Nebraska, residents get to take aerial tours of the city's Christmas lights for $15. In Altoona, Pennsylvania, residents got free 10-minute flights to reach the local airfield's goal of 10,000 passengers.

Sen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican who is a frequent critic of federal spending, said ""about 40"" airports are believed to offer similar flight programs to reach the threshold, which was set by Congress. Coburn is asking the FAA and the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to come up with a definitive figure.

""The whole purpose for that isn't to say what you're doing is illegal -- it's probably not -- but to have a more cogent policy that truly represents the needs based on enplanements for every airport,"" Coburn said. He said federal support for small airports like Clarksburg's ""should be earned in terms of grant process,"" not by gaming the system.

""We created the incentive to kind of weasel on it so you can get more money, and it's exacerbated now because of the economic downturn,"" Coburn said.

Clarksburg is about 200 miles west of Washington and about 110 miles south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where most area residents catch flights when they travel by air. But airport director Rick Rock said an economic benefit analysis said the facility contributes about $395 million into the local economy, ""So I definitely think there's no question that we need this airport.""

In addition to the $1 million based on passenger traffic, the Clarksburg airport got $30 million to lengthen its runway in 1999 and another $1.6 million from the Obama administration's economic stimulus bill in 2009. Local students get free flights to Washington for school trips as well, Rock said. And the airport just got another $150,000 grant from the FAA to promote itself.

Rock said the money is needed to meet FAA mandates for security, runway paving and safety, and he's proud of what the facility has achieved -- particularly for students.

""We're trying to introduce aviation to them at a young age, so they can look at it as a career,"" he said. ""A lot of these kids have never had the chance to fly. We've been able to share that opportunity, and the kids love it. It's special.""

But Coburn said at least five airports have used ""creative ways"" to keep the money flowing in and has managed to get support for a congressional investigation to find out how airports like North Central West Virginia can get so much money for so few passengers.

2,"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- It's a common sight in the traffic-clogged streets of Istanbul, a city that straddles two continents.

Workers next to the spot where subway trains will one day emerge from the tunnel. Opening of the tunnel has been delayed by at least four years by the discovery.

A taxi driver, enraged by perpetually gridlocked traffic, stepping out of his car and yelling ""Maniac!"" at the man driving the public bus behind him.

For decades Istanbul has been growing at a breakneck speed; its population exceeding -- by some estimates -- 15 million people. Too bad traffic often moves at a snail's pace.

Most residents are quick to tell visitors the city's transport system is overwhelmed.

""Istanbul is a dynamically changing city, every year increasing in population,"" says Zeynep Buket, an engineer working with Turkey's transportation ministry. ""We are in need of radical systems, and this radical system is a mass transit system.""

The ""radical system"" city planners embarked on five years ago involved construction of a new subway tunnel beneath the Bosphorus Strait, the spectacular body of water that cuts this city in two. By the year 2025, engineers predict more than one million people a day will use the tunnel to travel between Istanbul's Asian and European shores.

""We will connect two continents, Asia and Europe,"" said Nusret Ilbay, one of the many engineers working on the $3 billion Marmaray Tunnel Project. He was standing on scaffolding, overlooking a gaping 30-meter deep hole that will one day be a subway station on the Asian side of the Bosphorus. A concrete wall is all that holds back a churning river of sea water. Watch video of the tunnel being constructed

""As you can see, some leakage on the wall face has been observed,"" Ilbay explained on a tour of the construction site. ""In order to overcome these leakages, we have applied chemical grouting.""

Legend has it, thousands of years ago Jason and the Argonauts narrowly escaped death sailing up the Bosphorus in search of the mythological Golden Fleece.

Today, engineers face equally daunting challenges building a tunnel beneath one of the world's busiest shipping channels, at depths of up to 55 meters, in an active earthquake zone.

First they dredged a trench on the bottom of the Bosphorus. Then, using divers and undersea cameras, they submerged and buried 11 massive pre-fabricated tunnel segments, almost all of them longer than a football field.

To enter the unfinished tunnel, visitors must climb down a steep staircase in a construction tower surrounded by water in the middle of the strait. During the descent, the temperature plummets and humidity rises.

Construction workers toil here in the gloom of this 1.4 kilometer long tube on the bottom of the sea, their welding torches spraying showers of sparks in the darkness.

One worker claimed that during the lunch break, when the machinery came to a stop, he could hear the sound of oil tanker and cargo ships' engines as they motored past in the waters overhead.

As a precaution in the event of a catastrophic flood in the tunnel, engineers constructed an emergency bunker on the bottom of the sea. Stocked with food and water and equipped with a heavy water-proof door, the ""emergency room"" is supposed to protect survivors for up to 10 days, until they can be rescued.

But, in their rush to modernize Istanbul's transport system, city planners ran into an unforeseen obstacle: history.

In Yenikapi, a neighborhood of textile factories and seedy hotels where one of the main transit stations for Istanbul's new subway and commuter rail system was to be built, archaeologists discovered the lost Byzantine port of Theodosius.

It was originally built at the end of the 4th century AD by Emperor Theodosius I  when Istanbul -- then known as Constantinople -- was the capital of the eastern Roman Empire. The port's harbor silted over centuries ago, and eventually disappeared beneath subsequent layers of civilization. Until its rediscovery in 2004, archaeologists said they only knew about the port from ancient books.

""This was a big moment of joy and happiness for us, an unexplainable feeling,"" recalls Professor Zeynep Kiziltan, the acting director of Istanbul's Archaeology Museum.  Look at pictures of the excavation »

""At around one meter below sea level, we started finding the remains of ropes. As we continued [digging] a bit more, the remains of a boat surfaced.""

Since that discovery, armies of hundreds of laborers and archaeologists have been working in a giant pit, three shifts a day, seven days a week. The scale of the excavation is unusual in modern-day archaeology, says Cemal Pulak, an anthropologist from Texas A&M University's nautical archaeology program. Look at a map of the site

""Its mind-boggling ... it really looks like an Indiana Jones-type operation,"" says Pulak, who has worked as a consultant on the excavation of the lost port.

The Yenikapi dig has uncovered an ancient armada: 34 Byzantine ships ranging from dating between the 7th and 11th centuries AD.

In one tent, two workers carefully uncover the ancient wooden beams of a 40-meter long merchant vessel. A third man preserves the wood by keeping it moist, sprinkling the relics with water from a hose.

Archaeologists have nicknamed this ship ""The Titanic,"" because it is the largest of the Theodosius wrecks. It is believed the vessel once carried wheat from Egypt to Constantinople. Scattered around the ship are shards of pottery, animal bones, and thousand-year-old clamshells.

Historians say the new discoveries include the first examples of ships being built using the beginnings of the ""skeleton approach"" to constructing the vessel's hull. Pulak says that marked a revolutionary change which transformed shipbuilding from ""mostly an art form to a science.""

""The earlier methods of building depended on verbal transference of the method from master shipbuilders to apprentices,"" he explained. ""The development of the latter method ... allowed for the speedy communication of new shipbuilding ideas that could be transmitted on paper. It is the beginning of engineering. Ships could be preconceived and pre-designed.""

""I think it is one of the unique projects not only for us but for the world,"" said geologist Yucel Yilmaz.

In addition to finding the timbers of thousand-year-old jetties and docks, which still jut up in straight rows at the bottom of the mammoth pit, archaeologists have uncovered the remnants of a pre-historic human settlement.

""The first man, about 8,400 years ago, came and started to settle here,"" Yilmaz said. ""There was no Bosphorus [then]. The Bosphorus was a river valley... the people who settled here walked across the Bosphorus.""

Plans to travel beneath the Bosphorus have been delayed at least four years by the excavation of the Theodosious Port. The postponement has added untold millions of dollars have also been added to the cost of the entire project.

In the rush to move forward, the residents of Istanbul have accidentally uncovered a valuable piece of their city's ancient past.

3,"(CNN) -- A Florida exterminator and father of four children adopted from Florida's foster care system has told police that a body found in the pest-control truck he was driving is one of them -- his 10-year-old daughter, authorities said Wednesday.

Jorge Barahona, 53, already faces a charge of aggravated child abuse for injuries to the dead girl's twin, Victor, who was also found in the truck, which was parked on the side of I-95 near West Palm Beach, Florida, officials said.

According to a probable-cause affidavit filed by the West Palm Beach Police Department, a roadside assistance ranger with the Florida Department of Transportation stopped to check the red Toyota pickup Monday around 5:30 a.m. and found the 10-year-old boy inside next to an open gas can.

The boy ""appeared to be in respiratory distress and (was) trembling"" and his clothing ""was soaked with an unknown chemical,"" the affidavit said.

The ranger then found Barahona on the ground beside the truck and called for help.

The boy was hospitalized in intensive care with severe burns to his abdomen, upper thighs and buttocks, the affidavit said.  While examining the boy, doctors noted he had sustained previous injuries, including a broken collarbone, a broken arm, scarring to his buttocks and lower abdomen, and ligature marks on both wrists, police said.

After Barahona and his son were taken to a hospital, a worker decontaminating the truck discovered the body of the girl, wrapped in a plastic bag, the document said.

Barahona told police he was distraught over the death of his daughter, and had intended to commit suicide by dousing himself with gasoline and setting himself afire, the affidavit said.  Barahona said he didn't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him, the document added.

""Basically, to paraphrase, he was stating that he placed his daughter in a plastic bag being distraught over her death,"" West Palm Beach Police Spokesman Chase Scott told reporters. ""He drove here from South Florida accompanied by his son, Victor. He then pulled off to the side of the road saying that he poured gas on his self, intending to light himself on fire. His son's head was in his lap and he decided, after giving his son some sleeping pills, that he wasn't going to do that.""

Barahona told police that he doused himself with gasoline and inadvertently got some on the boy, Police Capt. Mary Olsen said.

But, she added, the man's story doesn't add up -- there was no gasoline on the boy. Instead, he was covered with another chemical whose composition had yet to be determined. ""That's why we're still treating this as a hazmat (hazardous materials case),"" she said.

Scott said the chemicals were so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well, he said.

Victor, who was transferred Wednesday morning to a specialized burn unit at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, has not been able to talk to investigators because he is on a breathing tube, she said.

Olsen said police would decide how to charge Barahona further once the autopsy on his daughter determines her cause of death.

Asked whether Barahona has expressed remorse, she said, ""He feels remorse, but we're not getting consistent statements with what we're seeing in our evidence."" She added, ""It's a complex case.""

At a hearing Wednesday in Miami attended by Barahona's wife, Carmen, a judge ordered that the remaining two children in the home be placed in foster care.

Florida's Department of Children and Families had opened a child protection investigation within the past few days to look into a complaint involving the Barahona family, and it wasn't the first such complaint, spokesman Mark Riordan said.

Reporters in the courtroom Wednesday heard tales of abuse, mainly concerning the twins, from state officials and experts.  The caller to the child protection hotline in the latest case reported that the twins were routinely locked in a bathroom for long periods of time and had been bound with tape, the court heard. The story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home, officials said in court.

An investigator told the court that she had showed up last Friday night at the family's home but had not seen the children. Instead, she said, she had left the family's house after speaking with Carmen Barahona, planning to return on Monday. Asked why she had not planned to return sooner, she said, ""I'm not allowed to do investigations on a weekend.""

However, a spokesman for the department, John Harrell, said it is the job of investigators to follow through immediately or refer to someone else in the department to follow through when a matter is urgent.

4,"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- When Burmese commuters have an accident they don't dial 911 or any ordinary emergency service.

They call the country's version of Marlon Brando, a heartthrob in the 1980s and 90s who turned his back on the film industry to run a fleet of ambulances and bury the nation's dead.

A household name in Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, Kyaw Thu has starred in more than 200 films, and even took home a Myanmar Academy Award in 1994 for best actor in ""Da-Byi-Thu Ma Shwe Hta.""

He followed it up with best director for ""Amay No Bo"" in 2003, but by then his head had already been turned by the story of an old woman left to die alone in hospital.

""The doctor warned the patient's family that she was close to death. After that they disappeared. A few days later she passed away -- so this dead body had no owner,"" Kyaw Thu told CNN at this office on the outskirts of Yangon, Myanmar's largest city.

He later found out that the woman's family couldn't afford a funeral service. At the time, it wasn't uncommon; poor families would often sneak out in the dead of night to bury their dead, he said.

And so began the Free Funeral Service Society, founded in collaboration with multi-award winning late Burmese writer and director Thukha, which now also provides a free library, education, medical, dental care and disaster relief.

From films to funerals

Kyaw Thu's decision to leave the film industry wasn't entirely his own. In 2007, he was arrested and later banned from the film industry after being accused of supporting the Saffron Revolution.

That year, the Myanmar military staged a violent crackdown on the largest anti-government demonstrations since 1988. Led by monks, tens of thousands of Burmese marched through the streets to protest plans to cut fuel subsidies.

Kyaw Thu doesn't deny that he helped them but says that the society's policy of aiding people ""regardless of social status, national and religion"" meant that no one was turned away.

He says he's on better terms with the current government led by President Thein Sein, who came to power in 2011, ending 50 years of military rule.

However, he says not enough is being done to repair the country's patchy public services and protect the country's poor. ""We are showing the government what we need to do,"" he said.

He claimed the government is out of touch with what's happening on the ground, as are foreign investors, who he says go straight to the capital Naypyidaw to listen to politicians rather than the people.

""I want to make a suggestion: before they go to Naypyidaw they should meet the CSOs and NGOs who are really doing things for Burma so they know what's really happening,"" he said.

""So after they meet with the CSOs and NGOs they'll have information -- they'll know the reality. So they can criticize and they can negotiate and they can discuss with the government and other parties.""

He says other parties need to do more to deliver on their promises by using their own funding, rather than seeing him as a bank.

A country on the mend?

Kyaw Thu spoke with CNN as hundreds of delegates arrived in the country for the World Economic Forum on East Asia, two days of talks on how the country can shake off the legacy of its past.

As well as basic, if not non-existent, public services, the country is saddled with crumbling buildings, potholed roads, a patchy telecommunications network and an outdated electricity network that only services a quarter of the population of 60 million people.

Under the control of military leaders, Myanmar's economy stagnated so much so that in 1990 its per capita GDP growth was at a similar level to that recorded in 1900, according to a recent report from McKinsey & Company.

There's much that needs to be fixed, but money is needed.

Kyaw Thu's society relies on donations and an army of volunteers -- around 500 a day -- who do everything from carrying caskets to preparing bodies for burial. Trained doctors and nurses man the hospitals and clinics where patients are offered everything from eye surgery to maternity care and blood transfusions.

The extent of their work can be seen in hundreds of laminated photos pinned on notice boards, which line the halls of the company's headquarters. One shows a newly married couple -- still in their wedding clothes -- carrying a casket; they came to volunteer straight after the service, he said.

Others show shots of aid workers digging wells and bringing supplies to cyclone-hit residents, students sitting learning in class and then, incongruously, a couple of images of mutilated bodies -- all part of a day's work for the society.

Message to Burmese people: 'Please be united'

Kyaw Thu may be incredibly popular in Myanmar, providing services that in many countries are promised by politicians, but he says he has no plans to enter politics.

""No,"" he said, shaking his head, ""I have no ambition to make a political party."" He says his motivation is altruism; he doesn't need power, glory or adoration.

""When we are giving the aid to the people, we don't expect any kind of benefit or opportunity. When we help, if they're happy, I'm also happy.""

He supports Nobel laureate and leader of the National League of Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi -- her image hangs on the walls of his office -- but says Burma's people need to drop their unquestioning admiration of Suu Kyi and her father, the late General Aung San, and start following their lead.

""People are not following their speech. They are very impressed. They say we love Aung San Suu Kyi, we love General Aung San... but they're not following their policy. They're not implementing what they're saying. This is the problem with Burmese people.""

Kyaw Thu is dismayed by the outbreaks of ethnic violence around the country that have strained relations between Burmese Buddhists and the minority Muslim population.

He said the society has not been allowed to travel west to Rakhine State where Rohingya Muslims are alleged by human rights groups to be suffering systematic abuse amounting to ""ethnic cleansing.""

""They (the government) say it's very dangerous and very difficult. So we have no chance to go to the desperate people,"" Kyaw Thu said.

He said the pace of Myanmar's transformation, from a military state to thriving democracy at peace with ethnic rivalries, depends on the attitudes of ordinary people. Decades of military rule had produced bad attitudes, he said.

""If the attitudes of normal citizens change and are good -- within five years it will change,"" he said.

""I want to give the message to all people in Burma: Please be united.""

5,"(CNN) -- Somalia's government said Saturday they are investigating the death of a Malaysian cameraman who was shot dead when African Union peacekeepers allegedly fired on his convoy.

Noramfaizul Mohd Nor was travelling with a convoy of humanitarian workers when a contingent of Ugandan-nationals with AMISOM opened fire, killing Nor and wounding another journalist, TV-3 reporter Aji Saregar Mazlan, Somalia's transitional government said in a Saturday statement.

""The police and the security forces immediately reached the location of the incident and started a full investigation for the shocking action,"" the government said.

Attempts to reach AU representative were not immediately successful Saturday.

On Friday, Nor was heading to the outskirts of Mogadishu to cover a Malay-sponsored project to help drought victims on behalf of Malaysia's national news agency Bernama.

In an interview with Bernama, Malaysia's Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak said Nor was a ""hero.""

""He was willing to take the risk to provide extensive coverage of our missions to help others in many parts of the world,"" he said.

Reporters without Borders, an activist organization on behalf of journalist, said Friday that Somalia continued to be one of the most dangerous countries in the world for journalists, often caught in the cross-fir between Islamic Al-Shabaab militia and pro-government forces.

""Nor joins the long list of journalists killed in the course of their work in Somalia, Africa's deadliest country for media personnel with 23 killed since 2007,"" Reporters Without Borders said Friday.

""Despite the recent retreat by the Islamist insurgent group Al-Shabaab, the violence and fighting in Mogadishu have not stopped and covering Somalia continues to be extremely dangerous,"" the organization stated.

6,"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- When Jimmy Wales visited the headquarters of Hudong.com last month, he had one question for its founder: is it possible for Wikipedia to be the number one online encyclopedia in China?

Don't call me Jimmy: Pan Haidong, head of Hudong.com, the largest Chinese encyclopedia website.

""Absolutely not,"" was the response of Pan Haidong, head of Hudong.com, the world's largest Chinese encyclopedia website.

""Because there is Hudong here in China. Of course we are a copycat of Wikipedia but we have a lot of innovations, and we do a lot of work here in China so it is totally different actually,"" Pan told CNN.

It's been a year since China's government lifted its ban on the Chinese version of U.S.-based Wikipedia yet it remains unclear whether Wikipedia has gained any share of the country's massive Internet readership.

Shortly after Wikipedia was launched in China in 2002, the country's Internet censors began to intermittently block access to both Chinese and English versions of the online encyclopedia with the longest ban lasting around three years.

In recent months, Wales has held a series of meetings with officials from the State Council Information Office, the government body charged with internet censorship in China, to establish a dialogue between the Wikipedia community and Chinese government.

He says they have not discussed why the website was banned.

""We have a friendly relationship,"" Wales told CNN. ""But in terms of getting down to the nitty gritty of what happened, I have no idea. It is not really a big concern.""

What is a big concern for Wales is whether Wikipedia can compete with the country's two homegrown encyclopedia websites that emerged while Wikipedia was blocked: Hudong.com and Baidu Baike, an online knowledge sharing site launched by Baidu, the No. 1 search engine in China.

One challenge Wikipedia faces is it lacks the brand recognition in China that is otherwise nearly universal.

""I had an English-speaking, college-educated tour guide [in Beijing], and he asked me what I do?"" Wales told CNN.

""I said, 'I am the founder of Wikipedia.' He had a blank stare. He had no idea what Wikipedia was. This would not happen anywhere else in the world. Everyone knows Wikipedia if they are using the internet.""

Wales said he is trying to mobilize the local Chinese Wikipedia community to spread more awareness about the online encyclopedia but otherwise has not outlined a specific strategy to beat its more entrenched domestic competitors.

""I think I am going to have to come to China a lot and do interviews so people can learn about Wikipedia,"" said Wales. ""Once people come to understand it that will be helpful for our cause.""

'No reason for China to use Wikipedia'

Yet Wales' star power alone may not be enough to convert China's 300 million internet users into Wikipedians, or volunteers who run the website.

""There's, in fact, no reason for China to use Wikipedia, a service based 'out there,'"" Baidu's chief scientist William Chang said at a 2008 internet conference in Beijing. ""It's very natural for China to make its own products.""

And it is also very natural for Chinese to use domestic encyclopedia websites that some say are better suited to the online habits and informational demands of the country's exploding population of internet surfers.

""We know the market better,"" said Pan, founder of Hudong.com. ""That is why we can get a bigger share of it.""

Hudong has more than 3 million articles and 1.7 million registered users, according to its website. Baidu Baike has nearly 2 million entries; Chinese Wikipedia has just 280,000 and over 700 thousand members. English Wikipedia has more than 3 million articles and over 10 million volunteers.

""We have the largest team here who are more familiar with the wiki concept and wiki operations in China,"" Pan told CNN.

""Of course we are more focused on the wiki community, which means we need to get a lot of people involved to make it grow.""

Hudong.com utilizes a range of social networking functions to attract Chinese internet users, including chat forums, fan groups, short messaging services and bulletin boards. Nearly 100 million Chinese netizens regularly visit online bulletin boards, according to research from China Internet Network Information Center.

The website rewards members through a ranking system where users are upgraded to a higher status on the site based on the points they earn. Members also can win prizes, like laptops and iPods, for high participation on the site. Baidu Baike has a similar model.

Wikipedia uses a reputation system to promote its members based on their participation on the website and the quality of the content they contribute. Promotion is subject to peer approval, and the site's volunteer administrators are elected by the community.

""The entry barrier is really high on Wikipedia for Chinese users,"" said Pan. ""We don't have a very hierarchical structure to say who is managing this or who is managing that.""

Instead both Hudong.com and Baidu Baike have a centralized management structure. Paid staff are charged with mobilizing the community to contribute to certain topics as well as filter out content that might offend the Chinese government.

Saying 'no' to censorship

Wales has refused to comply with Chinese censorship rules, which means certain pages containing sensitive information on both English and Chinese Wikipedia remain inaccessible.

""The question is how comfortable is China about just describing the facts?"" said Wales.

""In some cases that is not completely clear, so right now there are certain pages that are filtered from Wikipedia. We don't support that but we also can't do anything about it. But it is far better than just blocking the entire site. Far better for China and for us.""

Since Hudong's and Baidu Baike's business operations are based in China, the companies have little choice but to comply with government policy or face the same fate as Wikipedia.

""If there is something that the government doesn't want, we don't talk about it,"" said Pan. ""We just follow the law.""

Which is why in the long run many Chinese Wikipedians say their website will win.

""I don't think they can become a reference book like Wikipedia because they don't have a serious community focusing on improving the quality of content as well as trying to respect neutral point of view,"" said Isaac Mao, a Chinese Wikipedian and blogger. ""They have to follow the hidden rules and you never know what those are.""

However Pan said Hudong's content, in time, will improve if the Chinese government continues to gradually loosen its grip on the internet.

""I have been seeing a lot of improvement,"" said Pan. ""So we should be glad for that, of course.""

Wales also said Wikipedia's reemergence in China, albeit at times unreliable, is a sign that Beijing's web policy is changing.

""We are hopeful,"" said Wales. ""Wikipedia has been open for more than a year, and we are hoping that will continue. We would like for Wikipedia to have as much impact in China as it has in other places around the world.""

Pan's doesn't believe it will happen.

""There is no way,"" said Pan. ""I don't want to be the Jimmy Wales of China. I just want to say that we want to do something good for society. That is our dream actually.""

7,"(CNN) -- Nine civilians died in an attack on a luxury hotel in the Afghan capital, a government official said Friday.

The dead were a mix of Afghans and foreigners, children and adults, according to Gen Mohammad Ayoub Salangi the deputy interior minister. Six people were also injured.

The incident began when four teenagers entered the Serena Hotel in central Kabul on Thursday and started shooting randomly, police said.

Afghan security forces killed the four gunmen, who police said were all under 18 and were ""government opponents.""

Police said they believe the gunmen entered the hotel by smuggling small pistols in their shoes, then hid in the bathroom for several hours before launching their attack.

The hotel also was the site of a shooting, in January 2008, that killed seven people. The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack.

This is latest attack to claim the lives of foreigners in the Afghan capital. Earlier this month, gunmen shot and killed a Swedish journalist in broad daylight. In January, a bomb and gun attack by the Taliban on a restaurant in Kabul killed 21 people, most of them foreigners.

Earlier, in eastern Afghanistan, Taliban militants stormed a police station in Jalalabad, and a deadly gunbattle ensued, the country's Interior Ministry said.

At least 11 people were killed and 22 were injured at the station, and at least six attackers were killed, according to a doctor at the hospital.

This came as the militant group threatened to carry out attacks before next month's presidential election.

Afghan Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed the action to CNN. He said fighters will ""continue to attack the pro-U.S. Afghan establishment.""

8,"Miami (CNN) -- The 9-year-old girl critically injured when an airplane struck her on a Florida beach last weekend has died, the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday.

The girl, Oceana Irizarry, and her father, Ommy Irizarry, 36, of Georgia were struck Sunday afternoon by a plane making an emergency landing, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The father died at the scene, and the girl was rushed to a hospital.

Venice Municipal Airport officials reported a plane in distress Sunday afternoon, sheriff's spokeswoman Wendy Rose said.

The pilot of a 1972 Piper Cherokee radioed that he would be unable to make it back to the airport and that he was instead going to attempt a landing on Caspersen Beach, just to the south.

The pilot, Karl Kokomoor, and his passenger, David Theen, were uninjured. They are from Englewood, Florida.

Kokomoor -- the president and CEO of local engineering firm -- is ""emotionally distraught and devastated,"" his pastor, Victor Willis, said Tuesday.

""Words cannot express the sorrow I feel,"" said a statement that was read by Willis.

'Never saw them'

Kokomoor said that he was losing altitude fast and had little time to make a decision. He said he aimed for an area on the water's edge that appeared to be remote.

""I never saw them,"" he said. ""It was only after I landed and we exited the plane that I realized that there were people on the beach.""

The investigation into the crash is being conducted by the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board.

The death investigation -- which is being conducted by the sheriff's office -- will determine if Kokomoor will face any charges, said Rose.

""I send my heartfelt apologies to the Irizarry family for my role in this tragic accident,"" the statement read. ""I will fully cooperate with the FAA and NTSB in their investigations.""

Family was celebrating wedding anniversary

On the same day he died, Ommy Irizarry posted a love message on Facebook to his wife, as they were celebrating their ninth wedding anniversary.

""Thank you for being with me through thick and thin. I love you with all my heart, mi Roma. I am very happy and can't wait to see what the next 100 have in store for us,"" Irizarry wrote.

According to his Facebook page, Irizarry was originally from Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. He was an Army sergeant first class stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia.

He was a platoon sergeant assigned to Fort Stewart's Warrior Transition Battalion, the Army said. He twice deployed to Iraq since joining the Army in 2002.

""This is a heart-wrenching situation, especially losing loved ones while on vacation to celebrate a family milestone,"" said Maj. Gen. Mike Murray, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division and Stewart-Hunter. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the Irizarry family.""

9,"(CNN) -- Beset by war and sectarian violence, Iraq has not had a lot to laugh about in recent years.

But a trio of old friends from Baghdad have sought to change that, by distilling the jokey banter of their late-night drinking sessions into a controversial talk show.

Hosted by Yasser Sami and Walid Monam, and produced by their friend Ghazwan Al-Shawi, the show is called ""Akou Fad Wahad"" -- ""There is this guy"" -- the typical setup for one of their anecdotes.

The aim behind the production, says Al-Shawi, ""was to make people smile.""

""We wanted to do anything to make miserable and sad people happy,"" he said.

But while it's proved a hit with their predominantly male audience, not everyone appreciates their sense of humor.

Sami describes the first episode, broadcast in the summer of 2011, as ""very bold.""

""It got us into a lot of trouble because there was sexual and pornographic innuendos, so it was like a shock for all Iraqis,"" he laughs.

Since then, the show has routinely offended the conservative sectors of Iraqi society with its discussion of taboo topics including relationships and sex. A religious group staged a demonstration outside the show's studio last year, and government censors complained about the content.

Sami said a gang even turned up at his house, threatening him. ""I can't tell you (who) because this means I will give them another chance to come to me again,"" he laughs.

The jokes might not be considered particularly edgy to non-Iraqis -- or even necessarily that funny. A typical gag goes like this: ""A stoned guy bought two birds for his mother, one tweeting and the other silent. She asks, 'Son, why is it that only one of them that is tweeting?' 'Mother, the other one is the composer,' he replied.""

But although the humor may seem mild, Iraq is not yet ready for ""Akou Wad Fahad."" Sami says the team has had to modify their approach in order to continue broadcasting.

""We changed things in the show,"" he said. ""We used to have a female DJ, but we were asked to remove her from the show, and we did.""

Even in the new Iraq, said Monam, there are still many ""red lines"" that cannot be crossed in entertainment. ""Were it not for the limitations that are imposed on us, it would be a much better show. But we have to live with social taboos,"" he said.

Challenging this, he says, is ""impossible,"" at least for now. But as frustrating as it might be, he and his friends are content to tone down their act, if it means bringing a smile to people's faces.

10,"(CNN) -- ""It's the most wonderful time of the year.""

That's what Andy Williams sang 50 years ago, and for some, the song rings true. For others, left cold by carols and gift wrap, urgings to ""be of good cheer"" can be devilishly hard to escape.

Hard, that is, if you stick to your holiday routine. But what if you leave it all behind? Plenty of small-group escorted tours are still taking bookings for December, and if you're a solo traveler it's especially easy to snap up an available spot.

11,"(CNN) -- Federal civil rights investigators have found ""reasonable cause"" to believe that police in Portland, Oregon, use ""unnecessary or unreasonable force"" with persons who have mental illness, the U.S. Justice Department said.

The department's civil rights division and U.S. Attorney's Office in Oregon issued a letter to Portland Mayor Sam Adams stating that local and federal authorities will ""continue our collaborative relationship to craft sustainable remedies.""

In the 42-page letter, federal officials outline remedies that include training and new policies to investigate alleged police misconduct.

Investigators found cause to believe that the Portland Police Bureau engages in ""a pattern or practice of using excessive force in encounters involving people with actual or perceived mental illness.""

""We found instances that support a pattern of dangerous uses of force against persons who posed little or no threat and who could not, as a result of their mental illness, comply with officers' commands,"" said the letter, which was signed by Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez and U.S. Attorney Amanda Marshall.

""We also found that PPB employs practices that escalate the use of force where there were clear earlier junctures when the force could have been avoided or minimized.""

One incident in December 2010 involved several officers who used ""repeated closed-fist punches and repeated shocking of a subject who was to be placed on a mental health hold,"" the letter said.

Adams, in a posting on his web page, vowed that the city and its Police Bureau would improve quickly, and listed a series of changes:

-- The city will revise its use-of-force policies -- particularly those regarding the use of stun guns -- ""to ensure that officers have necessary guidance when encountering someone with mental illness or perceived to have mental illness.""

-- The police will expand their Mobile Crisis Unit -- composed of an officer and a mental health worker -- ""to ensure availability at all times and enhance non-law enforcement capacity to respond to persons in crisis that do not pose a public safety threat.""

-- The city will establish a mental health desk at its 911 calling center to ensure calls are properly dispatched.

-- The city will lead efforts to boost community mental health treatment options, such as establishing a 24-hour secure drop-off and walk-in center, ""that will provide police officers more options when assisting persons experiencing a mental health crisis.""

-- The city will use an early intervention system to identify officers, supervisors and units ""for non-punitive corrective action, and to assess gaps in policy, training, supervision and accountability.""

-- The city will move to speed investigations of complaints about possible officer misconduct.

-- A community body composed of representatives of a variety of groups will assess how well the agreement is being implemented, offer recommendations on additional steps, and advise the police chief and Adams on how to improve community relations.

12,"(CNN) -- Aid organizations have deployed emergency response teams to Haiti and appealed for donations after the Caribbean nation was was struck by a devastating earthquake described by local officials as a ""catastrophe of major proportions.""

The magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck southern Haiti on Tuesday, knocking down buildings and inflicting a new catastrophe on the western hemisphere's poorest nation.

Humanitarian charity Oxfam said Wednesday it was rushing rescue teams to the country from around the region to provide clean water, sanitation, shelter and emergency supplies and called for donations to fund its efforts.

Impact Your World: How you can help

""At this stage it is too early to tell the severity of the earthquake in Haiti, but the early signs are not good with communications down across the country,"" said Jane Cocking, humanitarian director of Oxfam.

Kristie van de Wetering, a former Oxfam employee based in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, said the situation in the capital was ""very chaotic"" with many buildings reduced to rubble.

""We can hear people calling for help from every corner. The aftershocks are ongoing and making people very nervous,"" she said.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said volunteers in Haiti were assisting the injured and supporting hospitals which had been overwhelmed by the disaster.

It said it had enough supplies in Haiti for 3,000 families. Experts in disaster response are due to arrive in the country later Wednesday to coordinate international relief efforts, it said.

""The most urgent needs at this time are search and rescue, field hospitals, emergency health, water purification, emergency shelter, logistics and telecommunications,"" the group said in a statement.

The quake struck about 15 km (10 miles) southwest of Port-au-Prince shortly before 5 p.m. local time, cutting off communications across much of the country.

""Port-au-Prince is devastated, lot of deaths. SOS. SOS...,"" wrote Louise Ivers, the clinical director of medical charity Partners In Health, in an e-mail to the group's offices in Boston, Massachusetts.

She added: ""Temporary field hospital ... needs supplies, pain meds, bandages. Please help us.""

Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the U.S., told CNN's Wolf Blitzer by telephone that the country was going throug

""I'm calling on all friends of Haiti and people who are listening to me to please come to our aid,"" said Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the U.S. told CNN's Wolf Blitzer by telephone.

""Today as Haiti is going through the worst day in its history I am calling for all others who got help from us in the beginning to help in support,"" Joseph said. ""The only thing I can do now is pray and hope for the best.""

Singer Wyclef Jean, nephew of ambassador Joseph, stressed the need for help for what is considered among the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere.

""We're going to need immediate aid,"" Jean told Blitzer on CNN. ""We're going to need the United States and the international community to react immediately."" He founded Yele Haiti, whose community service programs include food distribution and emergency relief.

In Washington U.S. President Barack Obama said the government would ""stand ready to assist the people of Haiti.""

At the Pentagon, the U.S. military said humanitarian aid was being prepared for shipping, but it was not yet clear where or how it would be sent. A U.S. aviation source said the control tower at the Port-au-Prince international airport collapsed, possibly hindering efforts to fly relief supplies into the country.

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters that Washington is offering ""our full assistance"" to Haiti. ""And our prayers are with the people who have suffered, their families and their loved ones,"" she said. The deputy chief of the U.S. mission in Haiti, David Lindwall, told Clinton that he saw ""significant damage"" from the quake and said U.S. officials there expect ""serious loss of life,"" Crowley said.

And Clinton's husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton -- now the U.N. special envoy for Haiti -- said the world body was ""committed to do whatever we can to assist the people of Haiti in their relief, rebuilding and recovery efforts.""

Haiti's government is backed by a U.N. peacekeeping mission established after the ouster of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 2004.

The United States has been heavily involved in Haiti commercially, politically and militarily for most of the last century. U.S. intervention under Clinton restored Aristide to power in 1994 after a 1991 coup, and a U.S. jet hustled him out of the country again in 2004 following a rapidly spreading uprising against his government.

With people stripping the trees for fuel and to clear land for agriculture, the mountainous countryside has been heavily deforested. That has led to severe erosion and left Haitians vulnerable to massive landslides when heavy rains fall.

Roads in Haiti were unsafe to travel on because of a lack of lighting and because many buildings along transportation routes had collapsed or were not deemed safe, said Ian Rodgers of the relief organization Save the Children.

""What I can hear is very distressed people,"" Rogers said. ""There is a lot of distress and wailing of people trying to find loved ones.""

A representative for the aid group Catholic Relief Services in Haiti described the situation in the nation as ""a total disaster,"" said Robyn Fieser, regional information officer for the group.

Haiti's dense population will increase the risk to its people, Jean said. The nation's need for aid will range from water and food to medical and building supplies.

""This is the worst devastation that we as Haitian people have faced,"" he said.

Hurricane Gordon killed more than 1,000 people in 1994, while Hurricane Georges killed more than 400 and destroyed the majority of the country's crops in 1998. And in 2004, Hurricane Jeanne killed more than 3,000 people even as it passed north of Haiti, with most of the deaths in the northwestern city of Gonaives.

Gonaives was hit heavily again in 2008 when four tropical systems passed through.

According to the U.N. Office for the Special Envoy for Haiti, unemployment reaches 70 percent nationally, and 78 percent of Haitians live on less than $2 a day.

13,"(CNN)  -- Be bold! Think big! Barack Obama wants to do just that. An $800 billion economic stimulus plan. Three million jobs. Health care reform. A restructured automobile industry.

Obama's popularity with voters will win him influence with political opponents.

Obama won the biggest Democratic majority for president in 44 years. His party made big gains in Congress. Democrats now have a majority of nearly 60 percent in both the House and Senate. President Obama's got a mandate. And a majority. What's to stop him?

Just this: the U.S. system of government. It is set up to make it difficult to get things done.

The Constitution was written 222 years ago by men who didn't trust government. They had just waged a revolution against a king. To the founders of the American republic, strong government meant despotism.

So they set up a system with an elaborate separation of powers. The idea was to ensure weak government.

The dirty little secret of American government is that it was designed not to work very well.

As president after president has discovered, there are innumerable ways opponents can stop measures from getting passed, even if the president's party holds a majority in Congress.

The Senate has its own rule that's not in the Constitution requiring a super-majority of 60 Senate votes to control the agenda.

A minority of 41 senators can ""filibuster'' a measure and prevent it from coming up for a vote. How many votes will Republicans have in the Senate? 41 or 42, depending on the outcome in Minnesota where ballots are still being counted.

Presidents often have problems holding their own party together. That's because members of Congress are elected by local constituencies and they are expected to represent local interests.

American politicians are independent political entrepreneurs. They are not foot-soldiers of a party.

When Bill Clinton first became president, he had a solid Democratic majority in Congress. But he could not get his health care reform plan passed.

After an intense advertising campaign by opponents, many Americans were worried that the Clintons were planning a government takeover of the health care system. The Clinton plan failed, and within two years, Democrats lost their majority in Congress.

One-party control didn't work any better for George W. Bush. Bush had trouble getting what he wanted -- notably, immigration reform -- from a Republican Congress. Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 2006.

But here's another dirty little secret of American government: it often does work. Very well in fact.

Under the right conditions, barriers fall away and things get done, sometimes with amazing speed and efficiency.

What are the right conditions? An overwhelming sense of public urgency. That sense of urgency certainly existed after 9/11, when Congress quickly passed the Patriot Act.

Getting anything big done in American government requires a sense of crisis. That's why politicians in the U.S. are always declaring crises -- a drug crisis, an education crisis, an environmental crisis. Or they're trying to rally the country to fight a war on something -- a war on poverty, a war on crime.

If the public urgency is not authentic, however, opponents won't have much trouble stopping things from happening.

Obama certainly takes office at a time of crisis, just as Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt did.

Like them, he has the opportunity to transform American government. Members of Congress who try to block President Obama's program may find themselves in political trouble.

Because there is yet another dirty little secret of American government: the United States is the most populist democracy in the world.

Here, the people rule.

When the people want something, they will get it, whether it's the death penalty or gun rights or lower taxes.

Why doesn't the United States have a metric system or dollar coins like other countries? Because the people won't use them.

Obama's popularity is soaring right now. When a president is popular, he has clout.

Everyone wants to be on his side, even members of the opposition party. They're in business for themselves, and supporting a popular president is good for business. Standing in his way could drive them out of business.

American government is not an efficient, well-oiled machine. It was never designed to be. It has to be lubricated by public pressure.

If the people are shouting ""Do something!'' -- as they are right now -- then something will happen. Even if it means a lot more spending and a lot more government.

The people reserve one key right: they will let the government know, rather quickly, whether or not it's working.

14,"(CNN)  -- From personal stories of growing up with gay parents to challenges of what defines a family, the public's comments on same-sex couples having families was supportive and critical, calm and heated -- sometimes all in one conversation thread.

In CNN's documentary ""Gary and Tony Have a Baby,"" Soledad O'Brien follows a gay couple in their struggle through the legal and personal obstacles to become parents. We asked readers and viewers what they thought about gay couples having families.

""Whether they are gay as a couple, or gay as a single parent -- as long as they love and nourish that child it will make absolutely no difference. Compared to the atrocious things that we read here on CNN about what parents do to their children, being raised by a gay parent will be a blessing,"" says one reader. ""I work in a medical clinic and believe me, the large number of gay people/couples that we see are a helluva lot more 'normal' (and pleasant) than the straight people/couples!""

Others said that while they were against same-sex marriage, they saw no reason for sexual orientation to prevent having children through adoption or other means.

""My morals and my religion agree that marriage is between a man and a woman,"" says one reader. ""[But] I don't mind gays adopting.""

Another said: ""Marriage is an institution created by God to join a man and a women. That being said, children do need someone to love and if that person is psychologically sound, physically fit and has the wherewithal to create a supportive and loving environment for the child, it would [be] hard for me to say no way.""

Some said having same-sex parents would harm the child. ""Children being raised by gay couples can easily be targeted by bullies,"" said one reader. ""These children will go through a great suffering because they will be confused as to why they don't [have] a daddy or a mommy. It's a shame that the children are being exposed to something that God is against.""

Another wrote: ""If there is a mother and father possibility, [a child] should always go in the favor of the normal mother and father situation. It is the responsibility of those in charge to give them the best chance to survive in a culture that is normally straight. I am not against gays, but I do think there is a reality that one gender of parents is not the norm.""

Other readers shared their stories of growing up with same-sex parents or being a gay parent themselves.

""As a gay single man, it has been my honor to adopt four wonderful children,"" one reader wrote. ""Over the years we have encountered the typical family pressures as everyone else.

15,"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama on Thursday said he wants the people of France to know the United States ""stands with you today, stands with you tomorrow"" in the wake of this week's terror attacks.

He made the remarks during an appearance in Knoxville, Tenn. to announce a new higher education initiative. Obama told the audience in Knoxville ""we stand for freedom, and hope, and dignity of all human beings,"" adding, ""that's what Paris stands for.""

""That spirit will endure forever,"" he added, ""long after terrorism is banished from this world.""

His comments follow a tumultuous few days for France, where two hostage situations and a shooting at a French satirical paper erupted in two days, resulting in numerous deaths.

Obama made a visit to the French Embassy on Thursday to offer his condolences following Wednesday's attack by three gunment on journalists at Charlie Hebdo, which resulted in 12 deaths.

The Charlie Hebdo attack: What we know and don't know

He signed a book of condolences for the victims of the attack shortly after returning from a trip to Arizona for a speech previewing his State of the Union address.

""On behalf of all Americans, I extend our deepest sympathy and solidarity to the people of France following the terrible terrorist attack in Paris,"" the President wrote.

""As allies across the centuries, we stand united with our French brothers to ensure that justice is done and our way of life is defended. We go forward together knowing that terror is no match for freedom and ideals we stand for -- ideals that light the world. Vive la France!""

Obama also met with the French Ambassador, GÃ©rard Araud, who called the visit ""a moving and highly significant gesture"" in a tweet.

""The French are grateful,"" the ambassador said.

Obama on Wednesday vowedÂ to ""hunt down"" the perpetrators of the ""cowardly, evil attacks,"" and the United States is supporting the French government in its investigation into the attack. On his flight back from Arizona, the President spoke with his national security team about the latest developments.

But when customs officials in Sydney X-ray scanned the parcel, they found instead five pythons and two venomous tarantulas.

On Tuesday, authorities raided the house in Sydney to which the parcel had been addressed. Officials seized evidence but expect to file charges later, the customs agency said.

Importing live animals without a permit is illegal in Australia and can yield a 10-year prison sentence and a fine of 110,000 Australian dollars ($92,000 U.S.).

The parcel was sent from the United States last week, but officials would not say specifically where it had been mailed from.

The snakes were wrapped within white calico bags and the spiders were packed in clear plastic containers, the customs agency said.

The creatures were later killed because they posed a quarantine risk, the agency said in a press release.

17,"(CNN) -- Jeff Yeager says the economic downturn is an opportunity for people to simplify their lives and be content with less.

More than 40 percent of the average household food budget is spent on eating out, says Jeff Yeager.

The author of ""The Ultimate Cheapskate's Road Map to True Riches"" has some ideas for saving $20,000 to $30,000 a year. The savings don't necessarily require sacrifices, he says, but rather choices that can lead to greater happiness.

Yeager talked with Heidi Collins on Tuesday on ""CNN Newsroom."" A transcript of their conversation follows.

Heidi Collins: How did you become a cheapskate, if you will?

Jeff Yeager: Well, you know, I'm about 50 years old. I grew up in the Midwest, and back then, spending money was really a last resort. We led sort of a simpler life, and I think, in a lot of ways, happier, Heidi. And that's really what I write about is, maybe there's a silver lining to this economic downturn. Maybe we can simplify our lives, be content with less and actually enjoy life more.

Collins: All right. As a fellow Midwesterner, I share your cheapskate thoughts already.

Yeager: You are a sister of the cheaphood. I knew it, Heidi.

Collins: Well, hey. I do wonder, though, as you've gone through this process, if you will, if you become the ultimate cheapskate, are you noticing now a lot more people kind of joining your club?

Yeager: You know, they are. And again, I don't really talk about a life of sacrifice. I talk about a life of choices and how, in many instances, less can be more.  Watch Jeff Yeager explain his savings suggestions »

You know, in this economy, we hear a lot of stories about how to get more stuff for 20 percent less. I'm not saying that's unimportant. But maybe we're missing the real point. The secret to the time is being content with less.

Collins: OK. Wow. I like the way you talk. All right, so let's get to these five things, because that's what everybody really wants to hear about. Specifically, what they can do. And again, this is in order to save 20,000 to $30,000 a year. Really?

Yeager: If these things apply to your family.

Collins: OK.

Yeager: And they are -- let me say in advance -- these are some fairly radical changes. But, again, it's probably not about sacrifice. It's about changing your life and maybe in the end being happier.

Collins: OK. Well, very good. First thing you say, give up your cell phone.

Yeager: Give up the cellulite life. I will use myself as a poster child. You know, I have a fairly successful career, a very happy life. I've never owned a cell phone, and nothing awful has ever happened.

Collins: Now, wait a minute. I've got to push back for a second, because a lot of people will tell you you can be happier with a cell phone because you're out of the office and you're with your family more, still able to still do business.

Yeager: We can debate all that, but 10 or 15 years ago, none of us had it, and nothing awful happened. It seemed to me we were really quite happy. Average cell phone plan costs about $100 a month. There's an interesting article in the recent Christian Science Monitor that shows the actual cost of using a cell phone could be more than $3 a minute by time you factor in unused minutes and so on.

Collins: Wow. All right. You say you might not need that second car and certainly not the third?

Yeager: Americans own about 2½ cars per family. Can you give up one? The Auto Club says it costs about, on average, $1 a mile to drive a car by the time you factor in the cost of the car, depreciation and so on. So, you could easily be talking about $5,000 to $10,000 savings by sharing the remaining car that you have, using public transportation and so on.

Collins: OK. Give up meals prepared outside your home. Quit going out for meals no matter what, if it's just a salad or a fancy fancy dinner?

Yeager: More than 40 percent of the average American family household food budget is spent on meals prepared outside the home. You can cut that by 80 percent by cooking those same meals at home and you know, maybe recapture some family time around the dinner table.

Collins: Yes, there would be people who would argue with you about that, though, too, because our culture is just so socially oriented to food. Every dinner, every business meeting, every lunch.

Yeager: We're too busy to cook because we're too busy earning the money to spend it by dining out.

Collins: Yes, yes. All right, you also say quit shopping for new clothes.

Yeager: Yes. Here again, it's what's good for your pocketbook and good for the environment. Less than 2 percent of clothes that we throw away in America are worn out. The average family spends about $1,800 on clothing. Certainly most of us have more than enough stuff in our closet that we could go six months, even a year without buying new clothes.

Collins: Yes, and then maybe just get it tailored or updated or something. Accessorize, I don't know, right?

Yeager: And again, less than 2 percent of the clothes we throw away are worn out. That's a waste of the Earth's resources.

Collins: All right. And finally, give up college room and board. You want the kids to live at home forever?

Yeager: This is a big one, you know? Back in my day, if you have a child in school, consider having them live at home while they go to school. It's been a huge generational shift.

Back in my days, lots of people, including myself, lived at home when we went to college. Therefore, we didn't take out any college student loans. Now, of course, most kids go away to school, take out student loans. When they graduate, what do they do? They move back home with mom and dad! Let's skip the money step!

18,"(CNN) -- We don't know much about the shooting at Los Angeles International Airport just yet, but it has clearly jangled our collective nerves, dredging up the fear and shock and pain of 9/11 -- the wellspring of our modern airport security process -- reminding us that more than a decade later, flying is still a fraught experience.

For those of us who were working for United or American, that day in 2001 changed everything. When we finally got back onboard, our workplace now included air marshals, armed pilots, martial arts lessons, tasers, fortified cockpit doors, and a new focus on vigilance, not warmth and customer service. ""Welcome aboard"" was less a greeting and more an opportunity to size you up.

So, reports of today's airport shooting raise new fears about weaknesses in this system. Is it possible that the gunman who shot and killed one TSA officer and injured two of his colleagues may have made it through LAX security with a high-powered rifle? (As of this writing, that is not yet clear.)

And is it time to start arming Transportation Security Administration officials?

No way.

I can understand the urge to react, to grasp at anything that might protect travelers. I too want air travel to be safe; hell, my husband is a pilot. But arming screeners at checkpoints well away from the airfield wouldn't be just another of the many precautions the airlines have taken to avert large-scale terrorism. It would simply be about protecting people from something that is everywhere in America: gun violence -- yes, at airports, and also at schools, at movie theaters, and malls.

If you're the kind of person who thinks that every teacher and hall monitor and mall cop and cinema usher should be armed, then you'll probably feel safer if we give guns to TSA officers. And maybe flight attendants and customer service reps and baggage handlers. And probably bus drivers and ballpark ticket takers, and hospital staff.

LAX shooting delays flights nationwide

September 11, 2001, still hurts, but most of our public killings have been at the hands of angry or disturbed co-workers, students, neighbors, family members -- not terrorists.

Do you really want to start handing out guns to the people you work with?

Probably not if you work for an airline where people are often underpaid, overworked, sometimes inhumanely exhausted and locked, perennially, in famously contentious relationships with management.

Even before 9/11, it made me nervous that as airline workers, we skipped security entirely, simply hopping off the employee bus and entering a back door, bags and bodies unscreened. I feared that the next air disaster would be caused by a colleague with a bone to pick. Of course, I was wrong, and thankfully employees' bags are now screened, but giving guns to airline and airport workers is still a disquieting idea.

I was never a fan of armed pilots, even in the nightmarish days after 9/11. Another flight attendant might have felt reassured but, when I once walked into the cockpit of a 757 to find a pilot with a gun resting on his lap, I was most decidedly rattled. I hadn't met the guy before and had no reason to distrust him, but even the thought of an accident was enough to make me question my safety (turbulence anyone?).

And a couple of chilling mishaps -- an inadvertent discharge in the cockpit of a US Airways plane and an incident where a JetBlue pilot lost his gun in an airport -- demonstrate the potential dangers of even a best-case-scenario arming of the nation's nearly 50,000 TSA agents.

Chaos, terror unfold inside LAX Terminal 3

Unquestionably, terrorism is a real concern for airlines, but like it or not, as Americans, we have also have to worry just as much about angry neighbors with guns.

To fight our justified fear, some will undoubtedly push for more guns and others for fewer. One thing is for certain -- we will continually be forced to debate this. I only hope that we can find some common ground before the next reminder.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tiffany Hawk.

19,"(CNN) -- Having established itself as Apple's top tablet competitor by going smaller and cheaper, Amazon will now go head to head with the category-defining iPad on its own turf.

Even as Google's new Nexus 7 challenges the Kindle Fire for dominance in the small-tablet category, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Thursday introduced a new, 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD.

That pits the new device, which will ship in late November, against a device with which Apple has, thus far, squashed all direct competition. No tablet that has tried to match the iPad feature-for-feature has gained more than a token foothold in the market.

So, how do the latest version of the iPad and the Kindle Fire HD stack up? Because only a few people have gotten their hands on the new device, some questions can't be answered yet. But here's a look at what we do know so far:

Price

The Fire comes out way ahead on this one, as is to be expected from Amazon, which has targeted customers looking for the basic features of a tablet but not willing to pay Apple's heftier price tag.

For $499, the cost of the lowest-end iPad (the 16GB, WiFi-only model), a buyer can get a 32GB version of the Fire HD with a 4G LTE connection on an upgraded cellular network.

The 16GB version of the Fire comes in at $299, or $200 less than the comparable iPad.

Size

While Amazon obviously closed the gap significantly, the iPad still has a bigger screen than the Fire.

Apple's iPad screen measures 9.7 inches diagonally, while the Fire is at 8.9 inches. That's less than the difference between the screen sizes on the iPhone 4S and the larger Samsung Galaxy S III smartphones. (There's speculation the iPhone 5 will have a larger screen).

But competition between Apple and Amazon could heat up on another front if rumors that Apple plans to release an ""iPad Mini"" turn out to be true.

Display

Both tablets feature high-definition screens, although the details vary.

The iPad's ""retina display"" featured a total of 3.1 million pixels, with a resolution of 2,048 by 1,536. By contrast, the Fire HD measures 1,920 x 1,200 pixels, with custom features designed to reduce glare and improve color saturation.

Both Apple and Amazon boast that the resolution on their tablet is so sharp that it's impossible for the human eye to discern individual pixels.

Data plans

Until now, the Kindle Fire has been a WiFi-only device, and some of its new models remain that way. But Bezos announced that the top-end version of the Fire HD is available in 4G.

The plan is offered at an attractive price of $50 a year. But that price gets you 250 MB of data per month -- not a lot for a device designed in large part to stream movies and other media.

It was unclear Thursday what the charges will be for going over the allotted data.

The $50 is well under what AT&T and Verizon charge for a year of data on the iPad.

When the first iPad launched, AT&T offered data plans starting at $15 per month, or $180 per year, for 250 megabytes of data.

Currently, Verizon offers a variety of plans, from 1GB of data per month for $20 (or $240 per year) all the way up to a massive 8GB per month for $80 ($960).

AT&T offers a 250MB per month plan (the same as the Fire) for $15, or $180 per year. For $5 more, customers can get up to 2GB per month.

There are obviously lots of permutations of plans customers can seek out for iPads, based on carrier and special offers. It's safe to say Amazon's is going to be less expensive, although it offers a minimal amount of data.

Apps

It's hard to compete with Apple's App Store.

There are more than 225,000 apps designed specifically for the iPad. Many work to take advantage of its display and screen size. Add the more than a half-million apps that run on mobile devices and you've got a lot from which to choose.

Amazon, of course, likes to play up the movies and books that make up its universe of content (and the sale of which make Kindle prices possible). Bezos lumped together more than 22 million movies, TV shows, songs, apps, games, books, audiobooks and magazines available from Amazon's store.

He showcased a few, nice-looking new apps. But while the Kindle Fire runs a modified version of Google's Android operating system, it only runs apps available from Amazon. That cuts the number available down to several thousand -- more than enough for many users, but nowhere near what the iPad offers.

20,"(CNN) -- Rock singer Sammy Hagar, a little older since his Van Halen days but still featuring bountiful blond curls, touted single moms, family and sex Monday night on the premiere of HLN's ""Dr. Drew.""

But for Van Halen fans, Hagar's memories of the band and how he would like to regain a friendship with Eddie Van Halen may have been the biggest draw.

""The greatest part of my musical career was being in Van Halen,"" said Hagar, who described to Dr. Drew Pinsky the alcoholism in his father and former bandmates.

One of the band members, Hagar said, went into rehab and got clean, but ""Eddie keeps falling down and would be in denial.""

Hagar, 63, claims Eddie Van Halen, who he says is doing better these days, is perhaps jealous of his success since leaving the band, a power hard rock mainstay of the 1980s and 1990s.

""They threw me out of the band, and they haven't done anything since 18 years later,"" said Hagar, author of a bestseller ""Red: My Uncensored Life in Rock.""

""He's got the biggest heart in the world,"" Hagar said of Eddie Van Halen.

In other comments, Hagar:

-- Recalled dreaming as a young man about an alien encounter, with blue beings and beams of light. ""You can call me crazy all you want. Anyone who says we are the only life in this whole vast universe, they are crazy.""

-- Admitted to many sexual consorts during his days on the road and between marriages. Now, ""I chase my wife around the house.""

-- Talked about being raised by a single mother in an abusive marriage. ""My mother made me feel love.""

-- He also spoke about his father who he said died in the back of a police car.""Because of my father I am very sensitive to it,"" Hagar said of alcoholism.

-- Touted old-fashioned hard work. ""I was willing to work my butt off for anything I could achieve,"" Hagar said. ""I came from nothing.""

Pinsky, who has been a physician for 30 years, opened the show with an answer to critics who say he can't diagnose at a distance.

""I have studied thousands of cases ... It's what I do.""

He said his work includes family issues, sex, addiction and other aspects of the ""human experience. Why we do what we do.""

21,"Washington (CNN) -- Naif Al-Mutawa anticipated a struggle when he launched an Islam-inspired comic book series that he hoped would become a symbol of tolerance.

He worried about the comics being banned in Saudi Arabia - which wound up happening, briefly -- and he expected to be challenged by conservatives in Islam, since Al-Mutawa wanted to buck the trend of Islamic culture being directly tied to the Koran.

But it wasn't an Islamic cleric that stalled the series, called ""The 99,"" after the 99 attributes of Allah, which the superheroes are supposed to embody.

It is the American market, and the voices of Islam's Western critics, that have caused the most problems for ""The 99,"" says Al-Mutawa, who is the focus of a PBS documentary airing next week.

In 2010, President Barack Obama called the comic books, which debuted in 2006, ""the most innovative response"" to America's expanding dialogue with the Muslim world, which Obama has encouraged. The series features 99 superheroes from across the globe who team up to combat villains and who embody what Al-Mutawa calls basic human values like trust and generosity.

But Al-Mutawa, a Kuwaiti-born clinical psychologist and graduate of Columbia Business School, says a vocal minority have raised surprising questions about American tolerance of Islam.

The idea for ""The 99"" started during a conversation in a London cab between Al-Mutawa and his sister. It took off, although slowly, after Al-Mutawa raised $7 million from 54 investors across four continents.

The first issue was released during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in 2006. The comic book was quickly banned in Saudi Arabia and Al-Mutawa received threats of fatwas against him and his project from clerics. But Saudi Arabia eventually lifted the ban and the television adaptation of ""The 99"" will be aired there this year.

Al-Mutawa and his team have now raised more than $40 million in venture capital for the project.

But when word leaked that The Hub, a Discovery Channel cable and satellite television venture, purchased the series and planned to air it in the United States, the response from conservative bloggers and authors was swift.

Pamela Geller, founder of the Atlas Shrugs blog, called the series, part of the ""ongoing onslaught of cultural jihad,"" and created a counter-comic strip that made the 19 hijackers behind the September 11, 2001 attacks the superheroes.

New York Post columnist Andrea Peyser, meanwhile, urged readers to ""Hide your face and grab the kids. Coming soon to a TV in your child's bedroom is a posse of righteous, Sharia-compliant Muslim superheroes - including one who fights crime hidden head-to-toe by a burqa.""

According to Al-Mutawa, the criticism spooked The Hub. ""All of a sudden we couldn't get an air date and I was asked to be patient and we have been,"" Al-Mutawa said. ""But it has been a year and the actual push-back died down.""

A spokesperson for The Hub told CNN that ""'The 99' is one of the many shows we have on the possible schedule, but at this time, no decisions have been made about scheduling.""

Al-Mutawa isn't shy about responding to the criticism his comics have received in the U.S. ""There is nothing different from them and the extremists in my country,"" he says. ""They are just as bad. They are just intellectual terrorists.""

Geller, author of the book ""Stop the Islamization of America,"" called Al-Mutawa's statement ""ridiculous victimhood rhetoric.""

""He is the one mainstreaming oppression and discrimination,"" Geller says. ""I work for equality of rights for all people. So which one of us is the intellectual terrorist?""

Geller also takes issue with Al-Mutawa's assertion that ""The 99"" exemplifies ""moderation"" and ""toleration,"" pointing to a ""burqa-wearing superhero.""

But Al-Mutawa says criticisms of burqas are evidence that, ""for some people anything to do with Islam is bad.""

""How clichÃ© is it that characters created to promote tolerance are getting shot down by extremists,"" he says.

Al-Mutawa's frustrations are chronicled in the new documentary ""Wham! Bam! Islam!,"" which will air on PBS on October 13 as part of the Independent Lens series.

The film's director, Isaac Solotaroff, began shooting before the comic was released.

He said that one of the most surprising aspects of the story is how ""a very small group of people who scream very loud, have a disproportionate share of the public discourse when it comes to culture.""

Echoing Al-Mutawa, Solotaroff calls it a case of the tail wagging the dog. He says that initial concerns of censorship in the Middle East began to change as the project progressed.

""We were waiting for a fatwa from a cleric in Saudi Arabia, Solotaroff says,"" when it ended up being the U.S. market that has been resistant to ""The 99.""

""Realizing that The 99 will not survive if focused solely on the Middle East, Al-Mutawa must now target an international and predominantly non-Muslim market,"" reads the website for ""Wham! Bam! Islam!""

Citing The Hub holdup, Solotaroff says the project is now stuck in the most important market"" for ""The 99.""

Al-Mutawa is also trying to gain distribution for his TV series in France and other countries, but his main focus remains the United States.

""One way or the other,"" he says, ""'The 99' will get on air in the U.S.""

22,"(CNN) -- A second Massachusetts compounding pharmacy surrendered its license after state inspectors found ""significant"" issues that could affect sterility, state health officials said.

The pharmacy, Infusion Resource, was also found to have a center for giving intravenous medications to patients in violation of state regulations, which require a clinic license, Dr. Madeleine Biondolillo, director of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Bureau of Healthcare Safety and Quality, said Sunday.

The state Board of Pharmacy immediately issued a cease and desist notice to Infusion Resource after the October 23 inspection revealed the violations, she said. Over the weekend, the Department of Public Health ""secured the voluntary surrender of Infusion's pharmacy license.""

The company, which compounds antibiotic and nutritional IV medications for home use, said in a statement it has since recalled all compounded products dispensed in the past month, effecting 38 patients.

""No issues were cited related to the integrity of our products nor to the quality of our compounding practices,"" said Bernard Lambrese, Infusion Resource CEO, in a statement.

""It is correct that Infusion Resource does not have a clinic license from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The space in our facility is intended for patient education, validation of patient and caregiver skills, medication counseling, medication education, teaching and training.""

What is a compounding pharmacy?

Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said last week the state would immediately begin unannounced inspections of all Massachusetts pharmacies and require that they submit annual reports detailing what they produce and distribute.

That announcement came in the wake of the fungal meningitis outbreak that has caused 25 deaths and 354 illnesses, linked to the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center. Seven of those illnesses are peripheral joint infections that specifically affect a joint such as a knee, hip, shoulder or elbow.

Infusion Resource is not linked to the outbreak.

The incident began unfolding September 24, when the department was notified about a cluster of six rare fungal meningitis cases in Tennessee. The patients shared several risk factors, including having received an epidural injection of a steroid -- methylprednisolone acetate -- that had been compounded at the NECC in Framingham.

The department soon learned that the suspect product had been distributed to more than 14,000 patients in 23 states.

FDA: Drug maker had internal warnings months before meningitis outbreak

The Department of Public Health has asked two other companies -- Ameridose and Alaunus Pharmaceutical -- to cease all pharmacy operations based on their shared ownership and leadership with NECC.

""NECC's transparency in dealing with the board since inception in 1998 demonstrates its good faith intention to operate in compliance with the requirements of its license,"" said Paul Cirel, a Boston-based lawyer representing the compounder, in a statement last week.

""Furthermore, the company's intention and best efforts at compliance are equally applicable in every other state in which it has been licensed.""

23,"(CNN) -- Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-2 at the Camp Nou on Wednesday to claim the Spanish Super Cup in an ill-tempered El Clasico clash.

Lionel Messi's volley two minutes from time secured a 5-4 aggregate triumph for Josep Guardiola's side, after French striker Karim Benzema's goal in the 82nd minute looked to have forced the Spanish season's traditional curtain-raiser into extra-time.

Tempers flared in injury time when Brazilian full-back Marcelo's dismissal for a lunging tackle on Barca debutant Cesc Fabregas sparked a mass brawl between the two sets of players.

Barca's Spain striker David Villa and Real's Germany playmaker Mesut Ozil were red-carded for their involvement in the melee, despite both players having already been substituted.

Real coach Jose Mourinho also became involved when he was seen to poke the eye of Guardiola's assistant Tito Vilanova.

Recent matches between the two teams have seen similar scenes, with five clashes between the archrivals last season resulting in five red cards.

Having drawn Sunday's first leg 2-2 at the Bernabeu, European champions Barca went ahead in the tie when Andres Iniesta latched onto a through ball from FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Messi and clipped a finish over Iker Casillas in the Real goal.

Copa del Rey winners Real equalized five minutes later, when Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo prodded Benzema's low cross into the back of the net.

Barca regained the lead on the brink of half-time, when Messi found the net following a neat back-heel from center-back Gerard Pique.

Benzema scored a second equalizer for Real before Messi's late strike stole glory for Barca, but Mourinho was happy with what he saw from his charges.

""Real Madrid gave a spectacular performance from the first to the last minute,"" Mourinho told the nine-time European champion's web site. ""I just say what I think. We came here to play.

Former Inter coach Mourinho stopped short of criticizing the referee for sending off two of his players, but the 48-year-old did appear to suggest Barca's players had made the most of the fouls which were committed.

""The referee must punish what he deems punishable,"" he said. ""Pepe and Marcelo played a great game, one for the entire 90 minutes and the other for 45. Pepe saw a booking for a minor tackle and Marcelo gave a great performance.

""I'm not going to say we're happy because we didn't win the Spanish Super Cup; that would be hypocritical of me. We intend to play like men and not fall on the ground at the slightest touch.""

Guardiola has now won 11 major honors since becoming Barca coach in 2008 and the former club captain was delighted with his team's performance.

""What will stay with me is the inhuman effort of the players,"" he said. ""They responded like the players they are: eternal, mythical, unrepeatable, honest, who like to train and play football.

24,"(CNN) -- The inaugural addresses of the presidents are, for the most part, a wasteland of howling rhetoric and dried-out inspiration.

History has little noted, nor has it long remembered, more than a handful of them. Lincoln's two inaugural addresses stand (of course) as the great exception. Franklin Roosevelt's addresses in 1933 and 1937 remain alive, as does the sonorous rhetoric of John F. Kennedy's address in 1961. We continue to quote a single sentence from Thomas Jefferson's first inaugural, a sentence from Ronald Reagan's first and a two-word phrase from Lyndon Johnson's. After that ...

After that, you get a lot of this:

""Liberty -- liberty within the law -- and civilization are inseparable, and though both were threatened, we find them now secure; and there comes to Americans the profound assurance that our representative government is the highest expression and surest guaranty of both.""

Who said that? It could have been any one of 20 presidents. (In this case, the speaker happens to be Warren G. Harding.)

Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it.

Theodore Roosevelt failed. Dwight Eisenhower failed. Barack Obama failed the first time, and since second inaugural addresses are almost always even worse than firsts, it seems almost certain he'll fail again on Monday.

Why do inaugural addresses fail?

They fail for two reasons: One subject to the speaker's control; the other, not.

They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments. Grand language wrapped around a thin message produces only vapid blather.

Consider, for example, this passage from Obama's first inaugural address:

""On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord. On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn-out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics. We remain a young nation. But in the words of Scripture, the time has come to set aside childish things. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history ....""

Unfortunately for Obama, those words were false as description and therefore inaccurate as prediction. You might say that the line ""we come to proclaim an end to ... false promises"" was itself a false promise. Good writing can never come from bad thinking.

Zelizer: Learning from Lincoln, Wilson, FDR

But there's another source of failure, one not so easily corrected. Inaugural addresses can fail even when the ideas are clear, even when the writing is fine, if the addresses make commitments that the ensuing presidency cannot deliver.

Listen to this inspiring passage:

""The elevation of the negro race from slavery to the full rights of citizenship is the most important political change we have known since the adoption of the Constitution of 1787. No thoughtful man can fail to appreciate its beneficent effect upon our institutions and people. It has freed us from the perpetual danger of war and dissolution. It has added immensely to the moral and industrial forces of our people. It has liberated the master as well as the slave from a relation which wronged and enfeebled both.

""It has surrendered to their own guardianship the manhood of more than 5,000,000 people, and has opened to each one of them a career of freedom and usefulness. It has given new inspiration to the power of self-help in both races by making labor more honorable to the one and more necessary to the other. The influence of this force will grow greater and bear richer fruit with the coming years.""

""No doubt this great change has caused serious disturbance to our Southern communities. This is to be deplored, though it was perhaps unavoidable. But those who resisted the change should remember that under our institutions there was no middle ground for the negro race between slavery and equal citizenship.""

Those were the words of James A. Garfield. Between Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson, no president expressed a stronger personal commitment to equal rights for black Americans than Garfield in 1881. Yet this commitment is remembered today only by historians.

Garfield was assassinated in September 1881, serving barely six months in office. Even had Garfield served a full term, his efforts would almost certainly have failed.

Federal enforcement of the voting rights of Southern blacks; federal funding of equal education for black children -- to become reality, these aspirations of Garfield's required support from courts, Congress and public opinion. None would have been forthcoming.

Garfield's aspirations were doomed to fail by forces of opposition too strong for him to overcome. Garfield's noble summons went unheeded at the time and therefore inspires little interest now.

An inaugural address is a plan for what is to come. Even a good president can deliver a bad speech. In fact, they usually do. But however beautifully written, a speech can only be made great by the presidency that follows. An inaugural address is a plan, and the test of a plan is the result.

A speech can fail all by itself. Its ideas can be weak, its language can be foggy. But even if the ideas are clear and the words crisp, an inaugural address can be deemed ""great"" only if it is followed by actions that make good on its lofty words. This is why we still remember the mighty words of Lincoln and FDR and why we forget almost all the others.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.

25,"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 28 people are dead and at least 218 others were wounded Wednesday after three blasts during a Shiite procession here, authorities in Pakistan said.

Khalid Ranjha, a Lahore government official, said two of the dead are children and two others are women, and seven of those injured are in critical condition.

The three explosions occurred within a radius of about 600 meters (2,000 feet).

All three blasts were the work of suicide bombers, said Nayab Haider, a spokesman for the Lahore police. Police tried to stop the first suicide bomber as the procession was ending, but he blew himself up as the police officer caught up with him in the crowd, Haider said.

Three or four minutes later, the second blast erupted. It was followed 25 minutes later by yet a third suicide bomber. Police have found two heads and one body separately, said Haider, who said authorities had assigned 2,500 police officers to the procession after receiving a warning that it might be attacked.

Khusro Pervez, a senior government official, said the incidents took place around the time of the daily breaking of the Ramadan fast, and security may have been lax.

""At the end of the procession, security should have been more vigilant,"" Pervez said. ""The incident happened because of security breach.""

Pakistan is a largely Sunni Muslim nation, and the attack on Shiite Muslims conjures thoughts of the long-standing tensions between the two groups in the Middle East and Asia.

Paramilitary forces have been deployed to the streets to bring order. Local TV channels showed pictures of angry people burning vehicles, beating police and trying to break into a police station.

26,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- It was an image that got the nation talking: Two giggling young women in oversized sunglasses robbing a bank. The ""Barbie Bandits"" helped their hometown earn the dubious distinction as the nation's bank robbery capital.

Here one of the so-called ""Barbie Bandits"" is captured on surveillance video at a surburban Atlanta bank.

Atlanta's FBI field division topped Los Angeles in reporting the most bank heists, with 350 for the 12 months ending September 30, 2007, according to the FBI, which annually names areas most prone to bank robberies.

The Los Angeles area was No. 2 with 338 heists, followed by Philadelphia with 316. Just Thursday, two suspects overpowered a security guard at an Atlanta, Georgia, bank, took his gun, robbed the bank and fled with money in hand, police said. Eventually, police shot one of the suspects in an exchange of gunfire. Two more armed bank robberies took place in metro Atlanta Friday.

The FBI says violent crime is up across the nation, especially in major metro areas like Atlanta. So it's no surprise Atlanta has become a prime target for bank robberies, FBI spokesman Stephen Emmett told CNN.  Watch Hotlanta or Heistlanta? »

""This goes hand in hand with those figures,"" Emmett said.

Atlanta's rapid growth over the last decade has also been a factor. A recent Atlanta Business Chronicle article reported that metro Atlanta has 26 more banks than in all of North Carolina -- roughly one bank for every 3,500 people in the region.  See photos of bank heists in metro Atlanta »

""We would attribute a lot of that [bank robberies] to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area,"" Emmett said.

Atlanta's rise in bank heists comes just as Los Angeles has aggressively countered once out-of-control bank robberies. Los Angeles has gone from more than 500 bank robberies in the mid-2000s to this year's 338, the FBI stats show.

According to the FBI, its Atlanta field division reported 350 bank robberies in the last year -- the most notorious of which were the ""Barbie Bandits"" and ""Grandpa Bandit"" robberies. The FBI says 122 of the heists were armed robberies, or robberies where a weapon was visibly used.

Emmett said many more of the robberies were what law enforcement officers classify as ""note jobs"" -- where a robber gestures as if he or she has a gun on them in a demand note handed over to the teller. Also factored into the total number of robberies were ATM heists and a record nine armored car robberies.

Those armored car robberies are particularly disturbing to Emmett. ""Anyone that would confront an armored car courier knowing that he's already armed and in somewhat of a defensive posture, that mindset is very troubling for law enforcement,"" he said.

While Emmett said there is no ""typical"" bank robber, he said he has seen some trends, most notably that they are often people battling drug addictions. He also said bank robbers are often repeat offenders.

Two recent high-profile cases in Atlanta seem to confirm that. Two women dubbed the ""Barbie Bandits"" were arrested after working with a bank employee to rob a Bank of America in the Atlanta suburb of Acworth. They both later admitted to police to having drug addiction problems. Recently apprehended 69-year-old Bobby Joe Phillips, dubbed the ""Grandpa Bandit,"" is suspected to have robbed seven banks in Tennessee and the Atlanta area and had a criminal history.

Emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist. Joe Brannen, president of the Georgia Bankers Association, agrees, saying ""the average is $2,000 to $3,000. It's not as big a payoff as most people think it is.""

With the holidays in full swing, authorities are steeling themselves for a spate of bank robberies with robbers looking for quick holiday cash. ""I would make the assumption that a large part of it is the increased [financial] pressures this time of year,"" said Brannen.

The FBI advises banks to be extra vigilant this time of year and to keep a close eye on jittery individuals donning gloves, hats and sunglasses.

But Brannen says profiling people like that can be problematic.

""We've chosen not to go there. Here in Atlanta, lots of people wear head coverings for religious purposes. This is a free and open society,"" he said.

He said customers want to come into a bank unimpeded -- that 99.9 percent are just customers, not bank robbers. Brannen says banks do all they can to balance convenience for their customers and the bank's need for security.

""There is no good, magic solution."" he says.

Emmett said as long as metro Atlanta continues to grow, so will the number of bank robberies.

""This is something that is part of growth. We have more banks. We have more people. We're a big city now."" E-mail to a friend

27,"Washington (CNN) -- When the Obama administration unveils its National Security Strategy Thursday, it will be the first time a president explicitly recognizes the threat posed to the country by radicalized individuals at home.

""For the first time since 9/11, the NSS integrates homeland security and national security,"" according to highlights of the plan given to CNN by a senior administration official said.

The security strategy acts as a blueprint for how the White House intends to protect Americans. In the past, it has focused mostly on international threats. But National Security Adviser John Brennan explained Wednesday that a spate of terror-related plots in the United States recently prompted the Obama administration to include homegrown terrorism in the document.

""Such a strategy must begin with the recognition that a clear-eyed understanding of our strategic environment -- the world as it is today -- is necessary to shape the world that we seek,"" according to a summary of the plan.

""Currently, the United States is focused on completing a responsible transition in Iraq, succeeding in Afghanistan, and defeating al Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates, while moving our economy from deep recession to enduring recovery. Even as we confront these crises, our national strategy must take a longer view. We must adapt and lead in a rapidly changing, interconnected world in which interests of nations and peoples are increasingly shared.""

Homegrown terrorism represents a new phase of the terrorist threat, officials said.

Earlier this month, Pakistani-American Faisal Shahzad was charged with trying to detonate a car bomb in New York's bustling district of Times Square.

U.S. Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan is suspected of fatally shooting 13 people at Fort Hood in November.

Colorado resident Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan national, pleaded guilty in February for conspiring to detonate explosives in the New York subway system.

David Headley, an American citizen from Chicago, Illinois, is accused of providing surveillance in the Mumbai, India, terrorist attacks that killed 160 people.

""We've seen an increasing number of individuals here in the United States become captivated by extremist ideology or causes,"" Brennan said. ""We have seen individuals, including U.S. citizens armed with their U.S. passports, travel easily to extremist safe havens, return to America, their deadly plans disrupted by coordinated intelligence and law enforcement.""

Brennan, who made his comments at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that as the United States has strengthened its defenses against massive attacks like 9/11, al Qaeda has shown itself to be a ""resilient, resourceful and determined enemy.""

Brennan said al Qaeda is recruiting individuals with little training, attempting relatively unsophisticated attacks and seeking people living in the United States to launch such attacks.

""They are seeking foot soldiers who might slip through our defense,"" Brennan said. ""As our enemy adapts and evolves their tactics, so must we constantly adapt and evolve ours.""

Brennan did not provide any specific details about the president's strategy for combating al Qaeda and its affiliates, but said it ""will require a broad, sustained and integrated campaign that harnesses every tool of American power, military and civilian, kinetic and diplomatic.""

The strategy is built  around protecting ""four enduring U.S. national interests -- security, prosperity, values, and international order.""

In order to achieve this, it must strengthen U.S. institutions, values, and infrastructure -- such as education, energy, science and technology, and health care.

It calls for strong diplomatic efforts internationally and galvanizing ""collective action to address the share global challenges of our time.""

""Engagement begins with our friends and allies -- active partners in advancing common interests. We will continue to deepen our partnerships with increasingly active centers of influence -- cooperating when we can, and differing when we must.

""With adversarial regimes, engagement provides us a means of testing intentions, giving governments the opportunity to change course, and mobilizing international coalitions.""

The strategy calls for updating ""all of the tools of American power, and work with our allies and partners to do the same.""

""These tools include those in the fields of defense, diplomatic, development, homeland security, the rule of law, intelligence, and strategic communications, as well as support the participation of the American people and private sector. We are working to strengthen each of these tools, but also to integrate them through coordinated planning and capacity building in key areas,"" the strategy said.

29,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry turned 25 Tuesday in the knowledge that he is now entitled to part of the multi-million dollar inheritance left to him by his late mother.

Prince Harry is currently training to become a helicopter pilot with the British Army.

Harry was just 12 years old when Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997.

His mother left an estate worth £21 million ($35 million), but more than £8 million ($13.31 million) was paid in inheritance tax, leaving around £13 million ($21.6 million) to be shared between Harry and his brother William, who is second in line to the throne, the British Press Association reported.

Much of that money is thought to have been invested but it is not known if the economic downturn has affected the amount.

Both princes are prevented from spending the lump sum of their inheritance until they turn 30. But Harry will pocket all income generated by his portion of the estate -- around £300,000 ($500,000) a year.  Watch more about Prince Harry's birthday windfall »

Prince Harry joined the British Army in 2006 and served in Afghanistan for more than two months from the end of 2007 to early 2008, before being withdrawn after news of his secret deployment leaked out to the media.

There had been fears that Harry, who is third in line to the throne, could become a target for Taliban militants.

According to British media reports, the prince's deployment was subject to a news blackout deal struck between the Ministry of Defence and newspapers and broadcasters in the UK and abroad.

He received a promotion to the rank of lieutenant in April last year and is now training to become a helicopter pilot with the British Army's Air Corps.

The young royal has also created a few negative headlines, particularly in Britain's tabloid press, in recent years.

In February this year, he was formally disciplined by his Army superiors after videos surfaced showing him using offensive language -- referring to a fellow soldier as a ""Paki"" and another as looking ""like a raghead.""

A spokesman for the prince told CNN: ""Prince Harry has apologized for his comments and has been subjected to normal Army disciplinary procedures. The matter is now closed.""

In a well-publicized gaffe in 2005, Harry apologized after he was photographed wearing a Nazi uniform at a party.

""It was a very stupid thing to do and I've learned my lesson, simple as that really,"" he said in an interview marking his 21st birthday. ""I'd like to put it in the past now. What's done is done. I regret it.""

30,"(CNN) -- The flight data and cockpit voice recorders from JetBlue Flight 191, which made an emergency landing this week, have been retrieved and will be analyzed, officials said Thursday.

The National Transportation Safety Board will download the data Friday, said spokeswoman Kelly Nantel. Information gleaned from them will be given to the FBI, she said.

Investigators are looking into the apparent midair meltdown of the captain, Clayton Osbon, whose remarks and erratic behavior Tuesday led the co-pilot to lock him out of the cockpit.

Crew and passengers subdued Osbon as he screamed and banged on the door so hard the first officer thought Osbon would come through, according to a federal criminal complaint filed Wednesday against Osbon.

The complaint says Osbon began making remarks during the flight that concerned the first officer, who is his co-pilot.

""Osbon yelled over the radio to air traffic control and instructed them to be quiet. Osbon turned off the radios in the aircraft, dimmed his monitors and sternly admonished the FO (first officer) for trying to talk on the radio,"" the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Texas said in a written statement. ""When Osbon said 'we need to take a leap of faith,' the FO stated that he became very worried. Osbon told the FO that 'we're not going to Vegas,' and began giving what the FO described as a sermon.""

It was not immediately known whether the alleged remarks are audible on the voice recorder. But federal regulations state that planes manufactured since 1991 must record cockpit chatter on microphones. The JetBlue plane was new and would be subject to the rule.

The cockpit voice recorder captures two hours of data and the flight data recorder, which measures the plane's speed and altitude, contains 25 hours.

About 3Â½ hours into the planned five-hour flight from New York's Kennedy International Airport to Las Vegas, the pilot left the cockpit to use the lavatory, but he failed to follow security protocol, alarming the crew, according to an affidavit filed in support of an arrest warrant. He then banged on the lavatory door and told the female passenger inside that he needed to go to the bathroom.

By that time, the first officer had summoned another JetBlue pilot who had been traveling as a passenger to enter the cockpit and the two locked themselves inside, the affidavit states.

From the cabin, Osbon tried to enter his security code to gain access to the cockpit ""and he banged on the door hard enough that the FO thought he was coming through the door,"" according to the affidavit. But the door held and, over the PA, the first officer ordered passengers to restrain Osbon. Several did just that, subduing the pilot in the forward galley.

Osbon, who was been charged with interfering with a flight crew, has not made a public statement. He has been suspended pending an investigation and is receiving medical treatment, the airline said Wednesday. A court official said Osbon was still under care Thursday.

JetBlue has repeatedly praised the first officer, along with an off-duty captain who stepped in to assist and other crew members.

Some passengers have referred to the first officer as a hero. But his mother said on Thursday that he would reject the label.

""Knowing my son, he would think that he's not a hero. He just did what he was paid to do,"" Jean Beatrice Dowd said of Jason Dowd.

""That's just his job, and he loves his job. He's just a quiet man.""

He called his parents the night of the incident, his mother said. ""He was pretty shaken up, and he couldn't say much.""

The incident took place on a significant date for the family -- the 10th anniversary of the death of Jason Dowd's older sister, who died of cancer, Jean Dowd said.

""I know he was thinking of her, too, at the time this was all going on,"" Dowd said.

The incident ""has been earthshaking for us, too,"" she said. ""To lose him would have been terrible for us.""

Jason Dowd, 41, who is married and has two young children, has not made a public statement. He was in New York, speaking with officials about the incident, his mother said.

After the incident, the flight made the emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas.

Osbon's stepmother said Thursday she has flown with him several times.

""He loved to fly, a love which he got from his dad,"" Judy Osbon said in a statement. ""He also took his piloting very seriously and was very good at it. I've only known Clayton to be a cheerful, conscientious and caring person.""

Her stepson was upbeat the last time they spoke, she said.

Osbon's father, Ronald, who was a pilot, and a passenger were killed in a 1995 airplane crash in Florida, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The pilot radioed he was losing power on both engines and was out of gas. The aircraft crashed near Daytona Beach Regional Airport.

31,"(CNN)Ferguson is crumbling. The cowardly and reprehensible shooting Wednesday night of two police officers came in a tumultuous seven days for the Missouri town, which had already seen Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson announce his resignation after a damning Justice Department report on its police department.

The report, which was ordered in the wake of the killing of Michael Brown last year, highlighted a predatory policing problem and a department that was biased, prejudiced and that has regularly targeted, arrested and fined African-Americans.

Residents understandably want justice. But what's worse in all this is that Ferguson is illustrative of a broader problem across the country as increasingly militarized majority-white police departments demonstrate consistent racial bias toward majority-black communities.

It's a combustible mix.

In three-quarters of all U.S. cities with populations 50,000 or more, the police presence is ""disproportionately white relative to the local population,"" according to The Washington Post. And tensions are being exacerbated by the use among police departments of military weapons, and stipulations that these former war zone weapons must be used within a year of acquisition.

All this suggests a need for a completely new mindset on how we try to understand and implement policing practices across America.  Indeed, a wholesale review of policies and approaches to law enforcement is needed, something that will likely necessitate drastic reforms in some departments so they can better represent, integrate, problem solve and liaise with the communities they are serving.

First and foremost, our police departments must better reflect the diverse demographics of our increasingly diverse nation, whether it be race, creed, sexual orientation and more. America is changing fast, but police departments aren't keeping up. Training and recruitment of minorities is critical, yet far more needs to be taking place. With this in mind, amplifying community policing models that work and scaling them up immediately is essential if we are to stem the growing and sometimes overwhelming tide of frustration, anger and cynicism welling up among young African, Asian and Hispanic Americans.

Second, we must radically rethink the trend toward the indiscriminate procurement and use of surplus military grade weaponry, which under the Department of Defense's 1033 program is flowing from battlefields to our local police forces.  When the weapons of war come home from Iraq and Afghanistan to help police America's cities and towns, then you know something has gone terribly wrong with this country. Mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles, tanks, drones, grenades and assault weapons should not replace the community policing of our Main Streets. Ferguson is an excellent example of how the deployment of heavy weaponry inflames rather than de-escalates a crisis situation.

Having military equipment on our streets does not make citizens feel safer, which is why the Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act was recently reintroduced in Congress. We do not need our officers looking like ""Robocop"" when they patrol our streets. It's that simple. Yet until such a bill is passed, war weapons will continue to flood our streets; Congress must act to stem this tide.

We understand that times have changed and that new security threats require new solutions and procedures.  But it doesn't justify the 150 raids per day by special weapons and tactics units for incidents that can be as benign as a Department of Education warrant. This kind of aggressive approach doesn't engender the kind of engagement necessary for identifying real risks lurking in a community.  In fact, the opposite happens.  Intelligence opportunities are dead on arrival, and potential allies who would otherwise be ready to help shut down immediately.

Aggressive military-type action is quickly turning Americans against fellow citizens who they are ostensibly there to serve and protect. We therefore trust that President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder will take decisive action, working hand in hand with police departments all across this country. Yes, the White House's task force on police militarization was a start, but more concrete measures are needed if we want to reverse the rising anger in Ferguson and elsewhere.

The time for a change is now. If we don't press our police departments to reflect the makeup and needs of our communities, then towns like Ferguson will unravel further.

Hank Johnson, Michael Shank: Policing style needs rethink"
32,"Rhode Island resident Lisa Kondvar remembers her mother as a beautiful, small and vivacious blonde.

So she was shocked to see the body of a tall brunette woman lying in the open casket at her mother's wake in New Jersey on December 9.

Right away, the tears and the crying stopped. Kondvar and her family immediately closed the casket and left the room, she said.

""It wasn't mom,"" Kondvar said. ""They sent us the wrong body.""

Her mother, Margaret Porkka, was vacationing in St. Maarten on the family's annual Thanksgiving trip when Porkka suddenly died after feeling light-headed.

Porkka, 82, was pronounced dead at St. Maarten Medical Center on November 29, the morning after Thanksgiving. Other than a pacemaker and a right hip replacement, Kondvar said, her mother was in good health and very active.

""It didn't make sense. She was full of life,"" Kondvar said. ""My mother was a picture of health. She ran circles around me.""

Kondvar said her family was told their mother's body had been taken to Emerald Funeral Home in St. Maarten, where the funeral director denied their request to see their mother and demanded a $7,000 wire-transfer-only fee to send the body back to the United States.

""That gave me a red flag,"" Kondvar told CNN. ""When I hear 'wire transfer,' I get cautious.""

Eager to get their mother's body back on American soil and not knowing of any alternative, the family wired the money and left their mother's passport, necessary information for the death certificate, and a set of clothes for the funeral services.

The body that arrived in a casket at the New Jersey funeral home on December 6 was not her mother, Kondvar said. But the body was dressed in Porkka's clothing and was accompanied by her passport and death certificate. The casket also had a small, red-velvet pouch containing jewelry and items that Kondvar said did not belong to her mother.

""There was a medical bracelet that said 'angina.' My mother didn't have angina,"" she told CNN.

Now, Kondvar and her family want answers, and they want their mother back, she said.

""It pains me that she's gone, and it's even worse because I don't have her and I want to hold her one more time, and I can't do that,"" Kondvar said.

Repeated calls to St. Maarten Medical Center and Emerald Funeral Home over the weekend were not returned. Kondvar said she hasn't heard from the hospital or the funeral home since leaving St. Maarten.

Kondvar, who is a nurse, said she contacted U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, for help. Reed, a personal friend of Kondvar, has been in touch with the U.S. consulate in St. Maarten and is closely monitoring the situation, according to Reed's spokesman, Chip Unruh.

According to Kondvar, Emerald Funeral Home in St. Maarten was supposed to notify the U.S. consulate of Porkka's death so the office could arrange for the body to be accompanied back to America. That never happened, Kondvar said.

As if the situation weren't already complicated, there's reason to believe that somehow her mother's body was mistakenly sent to a family in Canada and cremated, Kondvar told CNN.

""If it is mom up in Canada, we want her back. We certainly don't hold anything against this family because they're in grief,"" she said. ""I can't even imagine what they're going through.""

Unruh said Reed has expedited a DNA test to determine whether the body that was sent to Canada is in fact Kondvar's mother.

""It's a nightmare,"" Unruh said.

The government of St. Maarten issued a statement on its website explaining some of what happened.

Two women, one Canadian and one American, died on November 29 and were taken to the same funeral home, it said.  The government honored the families' requests to send the bodies to their respective homes, and the deceased women were flown to the United States on the same airline.

""Upon collection of the deceased the next of kin of both deceased persons claimed that this was not the body of their respective relatives and have lodged a complaint with the local law enforcement authorities. The body that was flown to Canada has since been cremated,"" the government website said.

DNA analyses ""will be carried out in order to verify conclusively the identity of both bodies. As soon as there is more information available it will be made available through the representatives of the respective Governments, the families of the deceased and the respective media outlets,"" the government statement said.

As Porkka's family awaits the test results, Kondvar said she has a terrible, gut feeling the body in Canada is not her mother's.

""If it's not her, I don't know where that leaves us,"" she said.

Kondvar told CNN the St. Maarten government is performing an internal investigation into what went wrong. But Kondvar is wary. She's been in touch with the State Department and wants to hire an international attorney to lead her own investigation.

""I want an outside investigation. I don't trust that government. They've hurt my family,"" she said.

Kondvar, a resident of Warwick, said she's not sure whether she will ever return to St. Maarten, although she has fond memories of the island and the residents from her family vacations.

""(My mother) loved St. Maarten. That's why it brings me some kind of peace, is that she died in paradise,"" Kondvar said.

33,"London (CNN) -- London's Heathrow Airport is ""fully operational"" and returning to normal after an emergency landing Friday forced the closing of both runways, the airport said -- but many travelers are likely to suffer delays anyway.

British Airways has canceled all its inbound and outbound short-haul flights until 4 p.m. (11 a.m. ET) as a result of the incident.

And Heathrow Airport has warned of disruption to travel that could last all day.

So far, 23 planes have been diverted to other airports and 19 flights canceled, some arrivals and some departures, a spokeswoman said Friday morning.

The airport is working to return to normal service as soon as possible, she said, but passengers are advised to check with their airlines.

A British Airways plane bound for Oslo was forced to make the emergency landing ""due to a technical fault,"" the airline said.

Flight BA762 turned back less than half an hour after taking off for the Norwegian capital, it said.

The Airbus A319 aircraft was carrying 75 passengers and five crew members, the airline said. The passengers were evacuated from the plane on emergency slides.

""Airline colleagues are now caring for customers in the airport terminal,"" said British Airways.

London Ambulance Service treated three patients for minor injuries after the emergency landing, it said on Twitter.

British Airways said it would be carrying out a full investigation into the incident, alongside the Air Accident Investigation Branch, part of the UK Department for Transport.

The slides were deployed on the left side of the aircraft, indicating that the problem was with the right engine, said CNN's Richard Quest.

Planes can fly safely even if only one engine is operational, he said.

London Fire Brigade said one of its crews helped the airport fire service put out an aircraft fire. ""We believe the fire is now out,"" it said via Twitter.

Heathrow, which is a major international hub, was ranked the third busiest airport in the world in 2012 after Atlanta and Beijing, according to Airports Council International.

Monday is a holiday in the United Kingdom, so many people will be taking flights Friday to take advantage of the long weekend.

Holidaymaker Aileen Wilson was one of many travelers whose flight was grounded by the incident.

""We've just been sitting, waiting in a plane meant to take off"" this morning, she told CNN iReport. ""At first we were told ongoing incident and then emergency landing. We (are) still waiting to take off (and) not allowed out of plane!""

Instagram user Shazia Shaikh took a photograph from the office where she works at Heathrow Airport of emergency vehicles surrounding a plane.

""Runways closed (and) lots of smoke,"" she told CNN iReport. ""The rain doesn't help. Emergency vehicles were quick to the aircraft I'm told.""

On average, 190,000 passengers travel through the airport each day, half arriving and half departing, according to Heathrow's website.

34,"Washington (CNN) -- House Democrats are bracing for a rough election night next Tuesday, and top leaders are making a major push for rank and file members to open their wallets to help save those vulnerable Democrats who are in danger of losing their seats.

House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep Steve Israel, D-New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, held a conference call Tuesday afternoon with House Democrats and told them it was time to pony up -- and gave them a Friday deadline.

According to a source on the call, a dozen House members and two Democratic candidates pledged almost $500,000 during the session.

Several Democratic sources told CNN that members are expecting Republicans to pick up some seats, but they still believe that many House Democrats in competitive districts are positioned to survive if they get support. The DCCC has invested heavily in field operations with 950 staff in 40 districts. But the surge of outside money from GOP groups on new television and radio spots, combined with contributions from several wealthy GOP candidates, has Democrats concerned.

In a memo circulated to House Democrats, the DCCC chairman argued that the uptick in GOP spending by outside groups was something the committee was prepared to counter. Israel wrote that despite the effort by Republicans and their allies, ""not a single Democratic incumbent is out of contention. This is a stark contrast from 2010, where many incumbents were already down and out despite our best efforts.""

But Israel also said, ""This climate is incredibly challenging and only getting harder.""

So, with seven days left before the midterms, the leaders stepped up the pressure on members to give now.

The DCCC has consistently out-raised its GOP counterpart over the course of the 2014 election cycle. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, House Democrats have raised over $172 million for the midterms, while House Republicans have raised about $131 million. For Democrats, much of the money has been brought in by top leaders like Pelosi, Israel and Rep Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat. The purpose of the call on Tuesday was to make it clear that they expect others, especially those who were given plum committee posts by their leaders, to lend a hand.

There are always members in both parties who sit on money in their campaign accounts at the end of an election cycle. Some of these members might be considering a bid for the Senate or governor, or may be reluctant to share the cash with their colleagues. But the ones who spent hours hosting fundraisers and trekking over to the Democratic headquarters to dial donors for dollars are frustrated with colleagues who don't reach their targets and don't seem to suffer major repercussions.

According to a DCCC dues sheet obtained by CNN, about 90% of House Democrats have contributed to the campaign committee, but 77 -- less than half of the House Democratic caucus -- have paid the full amount of dues for the 2014 midterms. Leaders were expected to raise between $450,000 and $800,000 for this cycle, and data from the DCCC shows 37 House Democrats exceeded their goals.

Democrats on key committees overseeing banks, telecommunications companies, and other industries who donate to campaigns are also expected to raise significant money -- between $200,000 and $500,000 per election cycle, depending on their committee and seniority. But the 2013-2014 dues sheet shows many of those committee leaders fell short on their fundraising goals.

For example, Michigan Rep Sander Levin, who is the top Democrat on the tax writing committee, gave $525,000 -- more than his assigned $500,000. But California Democratic Rep Henry Waxman, who is the most senior Democrat on the Energy and Commerce panel, and a close ally of Pelosi's, has sent in $10,000 of his $500,000 in dues. Waxman's office did not respond to an inquiry from CNN.

Internal tallies of members' campaign contributions are regularly shared among House Democrats. Making sure fellow Democrats see the spreadsheets that show who is paying up and who isn't is a tool leaders hope will shame those who haven't given significant amounts yet to write checks. But it's also a list leaders keep in mind when they decide who gets to keep slots on powerful committees in the next Congress.

35,"San Angelo, Texas (CNN) -- The Texas jury that found polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs guilty Thursday of sexual assault will deliberate again to determine his punishment.

Jeffs, who represented himself after firing his defense team, remained stoic as the verdict was read.

Jurors will decide his fate after hearing additional witness testimony in the penalty phase of the trial, which began Thursday evening and will continue Friday.

The sect leader faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for his conviction of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old and a 15-year-old who were his ""spiritual wives."" The jury convicted him of two counts of sexual assault on a child -- charges that stemmed from a 2008 raid on a ranch his church operates near Eldorado, Texas.

Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott hailed the verdict and said prosecutors were seeking a life sentence for Jeffs.

""Here in the state of Texas, juries render tough, swift justice against anyone who would sexually assault a child,"" he said.

Before the verdict, witnesses showed jurors DNA evidence they said showed Jeffs conceived a baby with a 15-year-old child. And prosecutors presented an audio recording that they alleged documents Jeffs' sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in the presence of three other ""wives.""

Abbott said attorneys were presenting new, ""repulsive"" evidence about the sect leader during the trial's penalty phase.

""I think it will confirm in (jurors') minds why they convicted the man and why they want to put him behind bars for a long time,"" he said.

Court adjourned about two hours after jurors reached a verdict Thursday. The trial was scheduled to continue at 10 a.m. Friday (11 a.m. ET).

Jurors deliberated for three hours and 45 minutes, starting Thursday afternoon. They sent out two notes during deliberations, requesting a CD player to listen to audio recordings and asking for the transcript of testimony from a witness.

Jeffs stood silently for most of his 30-minute closing argument Thursday -- the latest dramatic twist in a trial that included frequent objections and sermonlike speeches about religious freedom.

Jeffs stared at the table in front of him for most of his allotted block of time during closing arguments, as Judge Barbara Walther counted down.

He looked up at the jury when he reached the 20-minute mark, staring at each member. The jurors stared back.

Five minutes later, Jeffs mumbled, ""I am at peace.""

The leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints spoke so quietly that people in the courtroom strained to hear him.

Prosecutor Eric Nichols warned jurors not to be swayed by Jeffs' frequent invocations of religious freedom as a defense.

The case, he said, has nothing to do with an attack on religion. Instead, it is about Jeffs and his actions, Nichols argued.

He showed pictures of Jeffs' alleged victims as he summed up his argument.

Jeffs began the hearing on Thursday -- the fifth day of his trial -- by asking for what he called constitutional protection because he represents a religious organization. The judge immediately denied his request.

The sect leader then questioned witness J.D. Roundy, a sect member who also had taken the stand for four hours the day before. He did not call additional witnesses to the stand.

On Wednesday, Texas prosecutors rested their case after playing a key piece of evidence for jurors: a 20-minute audio tape that began and ended with a man saying prayer. Prosecutors alleged that the recording documents Jeffs' sexual assault of a then-12-year-old girl in the presence of three other ""wives.""

The girl had grown up in Jeffs' Yearning for Zion ranch, clearing cactus and attending a Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints school where Jeffs was principal, authorities said.

Prosecutors showed the jury a photo of her with her arms around Jeffs, and a marriage certificate which listed the girl's age as 12 at the time.

On Tuesday, the jury heard audio recordings that prosecutors said showed Jeffs instructing a 14-year-old and his other young ""wives"" on how to sexually please him in order to win God's favor.

Prosecutors said the 14-year-old was Jeffs' ""spiritual wife"" and conceived a child with Jeffs when she was 15.

Jeffs' trial started last week. He made no plea during his arraignment and remained silent for more than a day of the trial proceedings. But on Friday, he began repeatedly objecting -- at one point delivering an hourlong speech about his religious freedom ""being trampled upon.""

Jeffs could be sentenced to five years to life in prison on the charge of aggravated sexual assault regarding the alleged 12-year-old. For the other count, he would face a sentence of two to 20 years.

Jeffs' breakaway sect is believed to have about 10,000 followers. Their practice of polygamy, which the mainstream Mormon Church renounced more than a century ago, is part of the sect's doctrine.

The Texas legal proceedings began after about 400 children were taken from the sect's Yearning for Zion ranch in 2008. Jeffs was also charged with bigamy after the raid and is expected to be tried on that charge later.

Child protection officials said they found a ""pervasive pattern"" of sexual abuse on the ranch through forced marriages between underage girls and older men.

But the Texas Supreme Court ruled the state had no right to remove the children. The court also said the state lacked evidence to show that the children faced imminent danger of abuse. Most of the children were returned to their families, although some men at the ranch were charged with sexual abuse.

Jeffs was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list when he was arrested five years ago during a routine 2006 traffic stop in Las Vegas.

He was convicted in Utah on two counts of being an accomplice to rape for using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marrying her 19-year-old cousin. Afterward, he was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms of five years to life.

But in July 2010, the Utah Supreme Court overturned his convictions, ruling that the jury instructions were erroneous. Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff said last week Utah is prepared to retry Jeffs, depending on the outcome of the Texas case.

In Session's Christi Paul, Jim Kyle, Grace Wong and Keith Lovely Jr. contributed to this report.

36,"The Western Australian government caught 172 sharks, and killed 50 of the largest animals, as part of a culling program that has sparked anger among conservationists.

The three-month program, which ended last week, used baited lines attached to floating drums to catch sharks off popular beaches in Western Australia following a spate of fatal shark attacks in waters off the state in recent years.

The scheme, which was part of the state's $20 million shark mitigation policy, allowed for tiger, bull and great white sharks measuring longer than 10 feet (3 meters) hooked on the drum lines to be destroyed.

Some 50 tiger sharks longer than 10 feet were killed between January 25 and April 30. The largest one, which measured 14.8 feet (4.5 meters), was caught in February off Perth's Floreat beach.

Not the right culprits?

But none of the creatures captured were great white sharks, the species believed to be responsible for most of  the recent fatal attacks in Western Australia, which have left seven people dead in the past three years.

Under the program, another 14 sharks measuring less than 10 feet died on the drum line and four more were destroyed because they were too weak to survive, according to the government's figures published Wednesday.

Western Australia's Fisheries Minister Ken Baston hailed the shark mitigation policy a success, saying it was restoring confidence among beachgoers and contributing to research about shark behavior.

""The human toll from shark attacks in recent years has been too high,"" Baston said in a statement released to the media.

""While of course we will never know if any of the sharks caught would have harmed a person, this government will always place greatest value on human life,"" the minister said.

Conservationist's nightmare

But the scheme has been criticized by environmentalists who say the sea predators should remain protected species.

""Of the 172 sharks that were caught on the drum line, the majority were tiger sharks which haven't been involved in shark fatalities for decades in Western Australia,"" Sea Shepherd shark campaigner Natalie Banks told CNN.

More than 70% of the creatures caught on the drum line weren't large enough to be considered a threat or were other animals, like stingrays, Banks said.

While monitoring the government program, Sea Shepherd found that sharks released alive were in a ""state of shock"" known as tonic immobility and sank to the ocean floor, she said.

Hi-tech initiative

As part of its shark research and protection policy, the Western Australian Department of Fisheries is working on a satellite-linked shark tagging program that allows beach safety authorities to know, through near real-time alerts, if a tagged shark is in the vicinity.

Under the three-month cull scheme, 90 sharks were tagged before being released alive. Other animals caught on the line were freed, including seven stingrays and a north-west blowfish.

Beach closures due to shark sightings were also down this year, according to government figures. There were 93 closures in 2013-14, compared to 131 the previous season.

The Western Australian government is seeking approval to extend the program for three more years.

37,"(CNN)If Usain Bolt ever takes up figure skating, he will know how Kauto Star feels.

The 14-year-old racehorse, one of the greatest steeplechasers of all time and a two-time Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, made his dressage debut at London's Olympia Horse Show on Tuesday.

Dressage, which involves horse and rider working together to produce a complex ""dance"" routine marked by judges, is how Kauto Star has been spending retirement since his last National Hunt race in 2012.

Laura Collett, a leading British event rider, has been helping the horse to learn the intricacies of a sport that rewards precision and poise above power and pace.

""He's changed shape a lot since we got him,"" Collett told Horse and Hound magazine in the build-up to Kauto Star's demonstration dressage test at Olympia.

""He hadn't done any flat work at all. But he's got a brilliant temperament and he's very willing. He got the hang of it very easily.

""He needed to soften his whole body -- he was just used to going in a straight line. So he's done a lot of gymnastic exercises and things to supple him up.

""He tries really hard. When you've taught him something once, he remembers it. The hardest thing for him was the canter -- he only really knew about going fast.""

Having spent a career streaking past thousands of spectators lining a racecourse, Kauto Star appeared a little unprepared for an indoor arena crowd as he took his first, dainty dressage steps at Olympia.

""It's the crowds being up high and so close, it's quite intimidating,"" Collett told the BBC afterwards. ""He didn't show himself off to the best of his ability -- he got a bit of stage fright and shut down.

""Most horses who come into an arena like this have been doing it for eight or 10 years, and build up gradually. He's been thrown in at the deep end.""

Kauto Star is not in contention for Rio 2016. Britain has one of the world's leading dressage teams and no matter his racing pedigree, there simply isn't the time to bring him up to the required standard.

Instead, dressage is seen as a way to offer the horse an interesting retirement -- although that wasn't met with universal approval when the decision was made, two years ago.

Owner Clive Smith sent Kauto Star to Collett's Wiltshire yard in December 2012, against the wishes of the horse's longtime trainer, Paul Nicholls.

The dispute over the horse's future brought to an end a partnership responsible for almost a dozen major victories on the racecourse, a career bettered only by 1960s legends Arkle and Flyingbolt.

Now, by contrast, Collett says there is ""no pressure"" on Kauto Star to perform to any standard in his new sport.

""The main thing is the horse is happy and relaxed,"" she said this week, ""and he has a varied lifestyle.""

38,"Well, it seems the U.S. Navy finally got the memo: DON'T USE ALL CAPS! IT'S RUDE!

The Navy is switching to a new messaging system that's cheaper and more efficient.

And oh yeah, one that does away with a century-old practice: communications using all uppercase letters.

""Lowercase messages are here to stay; they provide a more readable format,"" a Navy news release said, citing James McCarty, the naval messaging program manager at U.S. Fleet Cyber Command.

The all-caps were a vestige of a bygone era.

Back in the 1850s, the teletype machines that the military used were made up of three rows of keys -- none of them lowercase letters.

Word of the change went out to all naval commands in April. But it didn't reach the rest of us until the news release this week.

In it, the Navy said it is ditching its in-house Defense Message System in favor of e-mail. One with a very apt acronym: NICE (Navy Interface for Command Email).

The switch will save the Navy $20 million a year. And it gets them caught up with current Internet protocol.

ALL CAPS READS LIKE YOU'RE BEING SHOUTED AT.

Old sea dogs may feel differently. But they have a couple of months to adjust.

The system won't fully be in place until next year.

Once it is, naval officers will no longer feel like they're being barked at.

Except, of course, in person by their superiors.

40,"New York (CNN) -- Decades ago, when the Department of Defense was creating the predecessor to today's Internet, one of the main goals was to create a communications system that could endure catastrophic disasters.

The Internet was designed to have no central point of failure, allowing anyone to run his or her own communications channel. This was a system that could withstand a nuclear attack.

Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.

During the days since the Haiti earthquake, the popular social networking and microblogging service has been used for rescue efforts and for fundraising to help stabilize and rebuild the country.

So it was big news when Twitter was offline for 90 minutes  Wednesday morning. Technology pundits promptly began hand-wringing -- the weaknesses of having a single point of failure to critical communications had been revealed again! Could we trust Twitter? Did this mean the Web couldn't help us fulfill our most basic obligations to those in need?

Not at all.

There's no reason that organizations or individuals who want to use the Web to relay critical information have to rely on Twitter or Facebook or Google or any other giant of the technology industry in the first place. We've just forgotten a bit about how the Internet was supposed to work.

Rescue organizations and charities should simply be able to use the Web sites they already have to deliver those messages.

And wasn't that the promise of the Web in the first place? Weren't we going to stop relying on individual companies as gatekeepers for communication? When blogs took off a few years ago, wasn't it with the promise that we'd all be able to share our voices without having to ask any company for permission? Why did we give that up?

Maybe it's because they made it look so easy.

Twitter has done an impressive job of growing to handle its enormous number of users, while keeping its service simple. The company has even shown a reassuring sensitivity to the civic and social obligations that come from running such a popular communication service. Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too. Their hearts appear to be in the right place, and they're doing real work to help people communicate.

But the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network. In my own work, I run a nonprofit that strives to connect government policymakers to the expertise of ordinary people using the Web.

We'll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it'd be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement. Telling people the only way to talk to the White House is on Facebook is like saying you can only call your senator by using a particular phone company.

And that's the key lesson to learn from Twitter being down while people are depending on it for communication: Some needs are too important to put in the hands of any single company. Communicating in real time about emergency information is clearly one of them.

Fortunately there's good news. Smart inventors have already made cutting-edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same immediacy as Twitter or Facebook.

Now the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook.

The reality is social networks come and go.

Ten years ago, otherwise-sensible companies were paying millions of dollars to America Online to buy ""AOL keywords."" These were shortcuts to parts of the AOL service, which dominated U.S. Internet access at the time. In fact, many of us have allowed companies to become intermediaries to all our communications, whether it was AOL 10 years ago or Facebook today.

But we don't need to ask gateways for permission to publish. We can run our own Web sites, at our own Web addresses and keep control over how we communicate.

Think how ludicrous it would seem for someone to decide, say, to offer emergency services as an AOL keyword called ""911"" instead of having people just dial their phones?

That sounds absurd, but you can see advertisements today that essentially say ""Find us on Facebook at facebook.com/AcmeWidgets!""

Now, Facebook probably won't fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster. But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier. And it is conceivable that the organizations and companies who communicate on Facebook today may want to become more independent.

Whether due to emergency or just the everyday requirements of doing business, they ultimately will stop depending on a single point of contact for their communications.

This is, after all, how the Web was designed to work.

We already see governments and civic organizations using the Web as effectively as the best corporations and media. In the United States, we have a White House that's got an iPhone application and a State Department that's asking us to define democracy by responding on Twitter.

Judging by how much technology has affected society already, those first experiments will soon evolve into full-fledged platforms for citizen participation and charitable action. And let's hope they won't have to worry if any one Web site goes down. Because we'll have a web of independent but connected communications systems, just as the Internet was always designed to be.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anil Dash.

41,"(CNN) -- The International Atomic Energy Agency issued a critical report Tuesday saying that it has ""serious concerns"" about Iran's nuclear program and has obtained ""credible"" information that the Islamic republic may be developing nuclear weapons.

The IAEA report, the most detailed to date on the Iranian program's military scope, found no evidence that Iran has made a strategic decision to actually build a bomb. But its nuclear program is more ambitious and structured, and more progress has been made than previously known.

""The agency has serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear program,"" the report said. ""After assessing carefully and critically the extensive information available to it, the agency finds the information to be, overall, credible. The information indicates that Iran has carried out activities relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device.""

U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the report had just arrived and refrained from commenting on details at an afternoon briefing. But a senior U.S. official called the report ""a big deal.""

""The report is very comprehensive, credible, quite damning, and alarming,"" the official said.

Read the IAEA report here

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad slammed the report as a fabrication of facts aimed at satisfying U.S. allegations about Iran's nuclear program.

Ahmadinejad essentially called Yukiya Amano, the director general of the IAEA, a U.S. puppet and said the United Nations agency has no jurisdiction in Iran.

""The Americans have fabricated a stack of papers and he keeps speaking about them,"" he said on state-run Press TV. ""Why don't you do a report on the U.S. nuclear program and its allies? Present a report on the thousands of U.S. military bases where Washington has nuclear arms that threaten global security.""

The IAEA had released another report on Iran in September but this one was highly anticipated because of the military aspect.

Since 2002, the IAEA has regularly received new information pertaining to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile, the report said.

It said Iran has made ""efforts, some successful, to procure nuclear related and dual use equipment and materials by military related individuals and entities"" and has acquired nuclear weapons information from ""a clandestine nuclear supply network.""

It has also worked on mastering the design of a nuclear weapon and tested components, the report said.

The IAEA said the some of the activities have both civilian and military applications, but others are specific to nuclear weapons.

Iran has repeatedly insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian energy purposes only.

According to the IAEA report, Iran is believed to have continued weapons research and technology development after 2003, when the intelligence community thought Iran had stopped. Instead of halting, it seems Iran took a temporary hiatus at the time, although the program progressed at a more modest pace since then, the report said.

After the report's release, top Republicans in Congress called on President Barack Obama's administration to ratchet up economic sanctions against Iran. Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, raised the fear that Israel would attack Iranian nuclear facilities without further steps by the United States and its allies.

Rogers, R-Michigan, said new sanctions should cut off the supply of refined fuel to Iran and target its central bank, which he said is being used to finance Tehran's nuclear program.

""If we talk about it for a long time, if we're not really leading on it, I will tell you we leave this option to the Israelis,"" he told CNN's ""John King USA.""

And in a written statement, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen called on Congress to pass two bills targeting Iran's energy sector. The Florida Republican leads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which recently sent legislation to the House floor to do just that.

""If fully implemented, they have the potential to cripple the regime's ability to continue its nuclear program,"" she said. ""If the Iranian regime acquires nuclear weapons capabilities, the U.S., Israel and our other allies in the region and around the world will face an unimaginable threat to our security. The clock is ticking.""

Previous IAEA reports have cited concerns by the organization that Iran has been seeking to develop nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles to deliver them.

Word of the latest report drew strong comments in Israel, where talks of how to deal with Iran have recently hit fever pitch. Israel considers Iran its arch-nemesis for its repeated innuendos about the destruction of the Jewish state.

Ahead of the report's release, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak warned that his nation would consider every option in countering Iran's bomb-making capabilities.

""Israel does not want a confrontation, but if it happens, the state of Israel will not be destroyed and there will not be 10,000 dead and not even 500 dead in any possible scenario,"" Barak said Tuesday on Israel Radio.

Iranian Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said Iranian armed forces were in ""full combat readiness and will give a crushing response to those daring to attack the country,"" IRNA said.

The United States, Vahidi said, was trying to ""promote Iranophobia"" in a bid to attain its ""sinister goals.""

Western powers have long suspected that Iran's nuclear program is geared toward weapons development. The United States is looking to increase the heat on Iran, including a possible strengthening of existing sanctions on Iran's financial and banking sectors and additional political pressure -- all of which could be applied by the United States alone or in coordination with other allies.

The United States also hopes international organizations, such as the United Nations, will take steps to further isolate Iran diplomatically.

Officials said that one of several options being considered is sanctioning the Central Bank of Iran, although the United States is mindful of the impact such a move could have on oil prices during a time of global economic turmoil.

U.S. officials said the Obama administration will use the report to lobby the international community to slap new economic sanctions against Iran.

Obama said he discussed the upcoming report with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Cannes, France, during a meeting of the G-20 industrialized nations. The U.S. president said the two leaders ""agreed on the need to maintain the unprecedented international pressure on Iran to meet its obligations.""

42,"(CNN) -- South African golf was handed another boost on Tuesday when the country was awarded the right to host one of the lucrative World Golf Championships events for the next five years.

The news comes after Charl Schwartzel joined 2010 British Open winner Louis Oosthuizen as a reigning major champion with his dramatic victory at the Masters on Sunday.

""This is, without doubt, the most significant milestone in the history of professional golf in South Africa,"" Sunshine Tour commissioner Gareth Tindall said on his return from Augusta following meetings with the U.S. PGA Tour and the International Federation of PGA Tours.

""It is something that we have been working on for a long time, and the unanimous support that we have received from the other professional tours around the world confirms the major standing of our players and the Sunshine Tour in world golf.

""What is even more significant is that we have the commitment that we will host this World Golf Championships event for a period of five years. That has enormously positive implications for the game and for our country as a whole.""

43,"(CNN) -- In a place accustomed to tough stretches, this has been a particularly tough few days at the White House.

After emerging from the showdown over the Republican-led government shutdown relatively unscathed, the Obama administration finds itself under assault on three fronts: problems surrounding Obamacare, the revelations of the U.S. spying on allies, and the 2012 attack on the U.S diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, the latter for which a senator has threatened to hold up all of the Obama administration's nominations.

The controversies are sure to fuel continued Republican attacks on President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies as the nation gears up for midterm elections next year, and the White House has portrayed the attacks as so much partisan chatter.

But to CNN senior political analyst David Gergen, they reflect the relative inexperience of the Obama White House.

""This is an administration that has been very, very good at its politics, but has never been very good at execution of policies from Day One,"" he said Monday.

""It's an administration which has some really smart people in it, and a lot of younger people. It doesn't have very many heavyweights.""

The worst part for Obama may be figuring out what to do about it all -- not just the various individual fires, but more generally how to ""take control of his own government,"" CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said.

If you're the President, how do you make sure that subordinates aren't withholding information you should know? How do you strike the right balance, and explain it clearly, on things such as gathering intelligence versus maximizing privacy and protecting key relationships? And how do you make sure those tied to your administration avoid big missteps that could come back to bite you?

""Four out of five Americans have little or no trust in their government to do anything right,"" Borger writes in an analysis. ""And now Obama probably feels the same way.""

Does Obama still have faith in government?

Here are the latest details on the issues causing the administration the most heartache today:

Obamacare

Another week, another congressional hearing on the problem-plagued rollout of Obama's health insurance program.

This time, Marilyn Tavenner, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- which is in charge of the Obamacare website -- became the first administration official to formally apologize to Americans for the troublesome start.

She offered the apology Tuesday in an appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee.

""We know that consumers are eager to purchase this coverage, and to the millions of Americans who have attempted to use Healthcare.gov to shop and enroll in health care coverage, I want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should,"" she told lawmakers.

Obamacare website administrator apologizes

The website, which would-be applicants have found difficult to use, at best, embarrassingly crashed over the weekend, leaving consumers completely locked out.

Then, the White House found itself on the defensive over revelations that, despite claims to the contrary by the Obama administration, some who have purchased insurance on the open market will lose their coverage and have to buy new policies.

An insurance industry source told CNN Monday that the vast majority of Americans who have purchased coverage on the individual market will find their policies changed or even canceled under Obamacare rules.

It's been known for some time that some of the policies would have to change -- the Department of Health and Human Services said in 2010 as part of a federal regulation that up to two thirds of individual policies wouldn't meet regulations allowing them to continue under what's called ""grandfathered"" status.

That refers to plans allowed to continue even though they don't provide all the rights and protections of those offered under Obamacare.

White House spokesman Jay Carney argued Monday the administration has always said some health care plans would not meet new Obamacare requirements.

""There are existing health care plans on the individual market that don't meet those minimum standards and therefore do not qualify for the Affordable Care Act,"" he said. ""There are some that can be grandfathered if people want to keep insurance that's substandard.""

And those who lose coverage will be able to buy more comprehensive coverage on the health insurance exchanges -- some of them at a subsidized price, he said.

But the reality that so many plans will disappear or have to change seems to fly in the face of what Obama said so often in selling the plan to voters.

""If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan,"" the president said in 2009, and frequently since.

It also offered Republicans ammunition to renew their attacks on the plan.

""The larger problem is how Obamacare is hurting people out there,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. ""It is about college graduates and middle-class families getting hit with massive premium increases they can't afford.""

NSA spying

After months of seemingly endless leaks about U.S. surveillance programs, the pressure on the administration rose to new levels in recent days with revelations published by the German news magazine Der Spiegel that the United States was collecting the communications of allied leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Obamacare and NSA spying: What did Obama know, and when did he find out?

German leaders respond angrily to the news, with Merkel demanding a stop to the practice and proclaiming that her country's confidence in the United States had been ""shaken.""

But it was comments by the administration claiming that Obama did not know of the practice until recently that drew the sharpest criticism -- from both the right and the left.

Rep. Peter King, the Republican chairman of the House Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, was incredulous that the president didn't know what was going on.

""He certainly should have known, if he didn't,"" the former chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room."" ""I think that's almost more of a serious issue that something like that at that level would be conducted without him knowing it.""

Rep. King on NSA spying: If Obama didn't know, he should have

And Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said not knowing about the program was a ""big problem"" for both Obama and the Senate Intelligence Committee, which she chairs.

""As far as I'm concerned, Congress needs to know exactly what our intelligence community is doing,"" her statement said. ""To that end, the committee will initiate a major review into all intelligence collection programs.""

Benghazi

Longstanding Republican criticism of the administration's handling of the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, which left the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans dead, resurfaced this week with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, threatening to hold up administration nominations over the issue.

Senators are expected soon to review Obama's nominations for several high-profile judicial appointments and other nominations.

Senate rules allow a single senator to at least temporarily hold up presidential nominations, and Graham says he will do so until the administration makes survivors of the attack available for congressional testimony.

""I'm going to block every appointment in the United States Senate until the survivors are being made available to Congress,"" he said. ""I'm tired of hearing from people on TV and reading about stuff in books. We need to get to the bottom of this.""

The White House said Monday that Graham and other Republicans are using Benghazi for political purposes, ""and we find that unfortunate.""

44,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is investigating a report that workers at the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were told to use lead covers in order to hide unsafe radiation levels, an official said.

The alleged incident happened December 1, nine months after a major earthquake and tsunami ravaged northern Japan and damaged the plant.

""We'll firmly deal with the matter once the practice is confirmed to constitute a violation of any law,"" said the ministry official, who could not be named in line with policy.

An official with the plant's operator, TEPCO, said the company received a report of the alleged incident Thursday from subcontractor Tokyo Energy & Systems. The report said a second subcontractor, Build-Up, created the lead covers and ordered workers to use them over their dosimeters, pocket-size devices used to detect high radiation levels.

The TEPCO official could also not be named in line with policy.

Tokyo Energy & Systems said in its report that the workers never used the covers, the TEPCO official said. Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper, however, reported Saturday that while some workers refused the orders to use the lead covers, nine others did use them for several hours.

The newspaper's report cited plant workers, who described the lead covers as fitting snugly over the dosimeters inside the breast pockets of the workers' protection suits.

TEPCO told CNN it ordered Tokyo Energy & Systems Inc. to conduct an investigation and is awaiting a reply.

Bale was rumored to be the finalist to play the Apple co-founder in the Aaron Sorkin-written film biography but decided he wasn't right for the part, said The Hollywood Reporter.

The Jobs biopic has been in the works since at least 2012, when Sony announced that Sorkin would write a film based on Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography.

Bale is the second notable performer to turn down the Jobs role. Leonardo DiCaprio was also pegged for the film. The Hollywood Reporter noted that neither Bale nor DiCaprio had begun negotiations.

According to Variety, Seth Rogen is being talked about for the part of Steve Wozniak, Jobs' Apple co-founder.

The film is to be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Filming was scheduled to begin this winter.

46,"(CNN) -- The melting glacial ice in places like the Alps, Greenland and the Himalayas is a dramatic visual document of how our planet's climate is changing.

For U.S.-based environmental photographer James Balog, it is a vision he has spent more than six years trying to record and preserve.

After an assignment for National Geographic in Iceland in 2005, he was shocked by the changes taking place and wanted to find a way to capture what was going on, in the Arctic and glaciers elsewhere around the world.

The result has been a new documentary film, ""Chasing Ice,"" based on 36 time-lapse cameras looking at 16 different glaciers in locations in Alaska, Bolivia, Canada, France, Greenland, Iceland, Nepal, the Rocky Mountains and Switzerland. Each camera has been taking a photograph every half-an-hour during daylight, producing almost one million pictures in total.

Balog says putting the documentary together has changed his initial skepticism about climate change.

""What we've seen has been a complete shock. I never really expected to see this magnitude of change. Every time we open the backs of these cameras it's like 'wow, is that what's just happened.'""

At one point in the film, Balog is shown looking at the memory card he has just removed from a camera and saying: ""This is a memory of a landscape. A landscape that is now gone and will never be seen again in the history of civilization.""

Watch: CNN special 'Secrets in the Ice'

Of all the places he has filmed, it is the Arctic that has attracted most attention in recent years. In September this year, the ice cap fell to its lowest extent on record. It grows each winter but is retreating further and further every summer, according to data collected by the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. The summer ice extent has declined by 13% each decade since the ice was first monitored in 1979.

Climate scientists have previously predicted the Arctic could lose almost all of its ice cover in the summer months by 2100. However, the recent accelerated ice losses have led some to believe that date could come much sooner.

While accepting that glacial ice melting has happened many times before in human history, Balog says what he is documenting now can no longer be considered a natural process.

""What we're seeing is a much more accelerated rate of change, especially in the past 40 years or so and that has clearly been traced by scientists to the impact of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions into the atmosphere.""

""In the past 100 years, the atmosphere has accumulated 40% more carbon dioxide in it than had been seen in the peak over the past one million years.

""So, in the past one million years the peak of carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere has been 280-290 parts per million (ppm). We're now at 395 ppm and adding more every year. It's gone beyond natural and is affecting the entire world,"" he says.

Balog, who lives in the Rocky Mountains near Boulder, Colorado, believes the economic and technological solutions to mitigate the impact of climate change already exist.

""What we need is a greater political and public understanding of the immediacy and reality of these changes. I believe that this film can help shift public perceptions by telling people a story that is real and happening now,"" he says.

47,"(CNN) -- So we thought Asian kids did great in school. Think again.

A new study suggests that women and minorities are less likely to receive early support from potential academic mentors. Researchers from Wharton, Columbia and NYU ran an interesting field experiment: Pretending to be students, they e-mailed more than 6500 professors at top U.S. universities admiring each professor's work and asking to meet. The e-mails were all identical except for the senders' names.

Names that one can associate with a gender or race -- like Brad Anderson, Meredith Roberts, LaToya Brown, Juanita Martinez, Deepak Patel, Sonali Desai, Chang Wong, and Mei Chen -- were used.

The researchers found that faculty were most likely to respond to e-mails from white males. But more surprising was the high level of racial bias against Asians and Indians -- professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students.

One of the researchers noted, ""We see tremendous bias against Asian students and that's not something we expected. ... A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group. We expect them to be treated quite well in academia.""

The study highlights the pernicious nature of the ""model minority"" stereotype of Asians, and the fact that Asians are still viewed as the most foreign ""other"" in our American culture -- perhaps the biggest outsiders in the politics of ""not like us.""

A common refrain I hear from well-meaning friends and colleagues is: ""What's so bad about the Asian stereotype? Seems to me Asians have done all right."" I get it. As a woman of color, I'm keenly aware that on the spectrum of bias, there are plenty of worse things to be called than good at school. It doesn't sound so terrible to be thought of as hardworking or quiet when there are so many more obviously sinister racial myths out there to bust.

But the flip side of the model minority myth is an assumption that Asians do just fine and don't need any mentoring or help in the academic or professional world. Whether due to bias or mere lack of interest, the professors in the study treated Asian and Indian students differently despite their reputation for academic achievement.

And this lack of mentorship while in school may lead to an achievement gap in the workplace. There's still a huge disparity between the percentage of Asians graduating at the top of their class from the best schools in the country and the percentage of Asians who go on to achieve top leadership positions in their chosen fields.

Disturbingly, I have heard thoughtful colleagues wonder aloud whether the underrepresentation of Asians in senior leadership roles is due to systemic, external factors that should be addressed with reform in the workplace, or whether it's Asians who are responsible for taking themselves out of the C-suite pipeline because ""they're just happy being the worker bees.""

Is there any truth to the perceptions that Asians are passive, lack leadership skills and assertiveness, are unwilling to take initiative or risk, and even unable to have fun or a decent sense of humor? Some people definitely think so.

I'm not the only American of Asian descent who has been told, in the form of a compliment, that I'm surprisingly outgoing, funny, or sociable -- for an Asian. I still get friendly compliments on my ""very good English."" And at one of my very first legal job interviews, one judge put it succinctly: ""I've always thought your people were very bright.""

It's the very benignity of these model minority stereotypes that render them so persistent and difficult to eradicate.

So, what can we do about it?

We can start by improving mentor and sponsor programs. Mentors and mentees are too often arbitrarily paired in the corporate world. Employers should consider the real affinities that may actually exist within their workforce and offer employees the tools, training and access to identify, cultivate and maintain their own meaningful mentor and sponsor relationships.

At one law job early in my career, I was assigned to a ""mentor"" who himself had only been at the firm a few weeks. Why? He was from Seoul. I'm from California and grew up in D.C. And I'm not even Korean-American. Meanwhile, I went to a college that graduates about 400 students a year, and a white male senior partner whose office was down the hall had gone to this same small college, yet no one at the firm had stopped to think that perhaps I might have something in common with him.

Sure, it's also incumbent on people to take initiative and simply walk down the hall and introduce themselves to potential mentors. But it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers -- in academia, the corporate world, public service, media, entertainment and the arts, whatever path talented young people might choose -- to recognize the subtle, unconscious biases that sometimes prevent Asians from achieving their true potential.

Maybe then Asians in America can be recognized for bringing more to the table than just being good at school.

48,"(CNN) -- San Francisco's new sheriff is facing misdemeanor charges over an alleged domestic abuse incident on New Year's Eve, authorities said.

Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, who was sworn in Monday, said Friday he will not resign.

""We are cooperating with law enforcement and the district attorney's office and will, of course, continue to do so,"" he told reporters.

The charges were announced by San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon, who also took office Monday.

Mirkarimi is accused of domestic violence with battery, child endangerment and dissuading a witness.

Gascon said there were a series of text messages between the sheriff and his wife, Eliana Lopez, the alleged victim, about the incident.

Lopez, standing next to her husband, called the charges ""unbelievable"" and said the couple would fight them.

""I don't have any complaint against my husband,"" Lopez said. ""We are together. ... this is completely wrong.""

Mirkarimi was booked and released on bail, San Francisco police said.

49,"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama has approved the use of armed Predator drones in Libya, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Thursday.

Gates suggested that the unmanned Predator missions may have already begun. He said he believed that the first flights were launched Thursday but were called back due to poor weather.

""The president has said that where we have some unique capabilities, he is willing to use those,"" Gates said. ""And I think that today may in fact have been their first mission.""

Gates said the Predator drones offer a ""modest contribution"" to NATO efforts to support rebels fighting embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces there, though Gadhafi is not a specific target.

Unmanned aerial vehicles offer more precise targeting, because their low-flying capability allows for better visibility, ""particularly on targets now that have started to dig themselves into defensive positions,"" Gates said.

He said the drones are needed for humanitarian reasons, and they have capabilities that larger aircraft such as A-10s and C-130s cannot provide.

Vice Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. James Cartwright said the added precision is necessary because forces loyal to Gadhafi ""nestle up in crowded areas"" to maximize civilian casualties.

""It's very difficult to identify friend from foe,"" Cartwright said, noting that the drones facilitate identification of individuals on the ground.

Remote Predator operators are now permitted to strike Gadhafi's defense missions, including air defense, missile and radar sites. Predator strikes are also authorized for civilian protection and can hit Gadhafi's troops, military installations and equipment in the field.

The U.S. employed the use of unmanned drones early in the NATO campaign, but they were intended for surveillance only and not authorized to fire.

50,"Fancy a stroll around the observation deck of the tallest building in the world?

Normally, doing so would involve a flight to Dubai, an expensive hotel room and a struggle through traffic under blazing sunshine. But now you can take it all in from the comfort of your own living room.

Google has launched a new project capturing a 360-degree view of the iconic Burj Khalifa in Dubai -- a building so enormous it is sometimes referred to as the ""vertical city.""

The images taken by Google allow users to navigate through the building, using Street View technology, which the company generally uses to map cities. Users can explore the structure from the opulent basement entrance hall to the highest occupied apartment in the world on the building's 163rd floor.

To compile the images, Google's photographers used state of the art equipment and battled 40 mph winds at the top of the building's spire, 828 meters (2,716 feet) above ground level.

The pictures will be the first time Street View has been used in the Middle East, and the first collection of images to feature a skyscraper.

The Burj Khalifa is the tallest man-made structure in the world. Modeled on principles of classical Islamic architecture. The building took six years and more than 22 million man-hours to erect.

The edifice's massive foundations required over 58,900 cubic yards of concrete, weighing more than 110,000 tonnes. Close to 26,000 glass panels, each individually hand-cut, were used in the exterior cladding -- equivalent to 17 soccer fields of material.

Google's Street View technology had to be specially adapted to document buildings such as this. The 360 degree cameras are mounted on a backpack which can be carried by a single operator. Other landmarks and natural wonders like the Eiffel Tower and Grand Canyon have also been captured by the technology.

51,"Super Bowl XLVIII started out bad for the Denver Broncos. The Seattle Seahawks made sure it got worse.

Seattle romped 43-8 by playing a suffocating defense and taking advantage of four Denver turnovers, including two interceptions thrown by quarterback Peyton Manning, the NFL's most valuable player for the season.

The game pitted pro football's best offense, Denver, against the best defense, Seattle, but the drama disappeared early at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

On the first play from scrimmage, a bad snap went sailing past Manning and landed in the end zone for a safety, giving Seattle a 2-0 lead without running a play. Denver didn't score until the third quarter, when the game was out of reach.

Seattle's defense was so strong that Denver managed only 27 yards rushing, compared with 135 for Seattle. Manning went 34 for 49 to gain 279 yards in the air, but most passes were for short yardage with his receivers quickly taken down. His counterpart, Russell Wilson of Seattle, went 18 for 26 to gain 206 yards and score two touchdowns.

Fittingly, a Seattle defensive player, linebacker Malcolm Smith, was named the game's most valuable player.

Seattle won its first Super Bowl in franchise history. Manning was thwarted in his quest for a second Super Bowl ring.

After the safety, Seattle kicked two field goals, and Marshawn Lynch scored on a 1-yard run for a touchdown. The Seahawks'  Smith intercepted Manning's second interception and returned it for another touchdown.

The second half started out bad for Denver, with Seattle's Percy Harvin running the opening  kickoff back for a touchdown.

Jermaine Kearse caught a 23-yeard pass from Russell Wilson with 2:58 left in the third quarter for another touchdown. Wilson threw his second scoring strike to Doug Baldwin with 11:45 left in the fourth.

Just before the third quarter ended, Denver got onto the scoreboard when Manning threw a 14-yard pass to Demaryius Thomas. Denver went for a two-point PAT to make the score 36-8.

Denver, led by the 37-year-old Manning, has the NFL's best offense, statistically, but never got moving Sunday.

Richard Sherman, the Seattle defense player who mocked San Francisco after winning the NFC championship, was never really challenged. He left with an injury in the fourth quarter.

Balmy conditions on Game Day

Though the game didn't experience the blackout that hit last year's Super Bowl, fans in Los Angeles had their own visual blackout.

Some fans lost cable service for a period and missed part of the second half and the halftime show, starring Bruno Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Time Warner cable said in a tweet that the issue was resolved before the end of the game.

A man was shot several times during a Super Bowl party at a residence in Denver, police said. The man was found outside the home, but police spokesman Sonny Jackson did not have additional information, such as what led to the shooting.

The man was taken to a hospital in critical condition, and authorities do not have a suspect or a suspect description.

52,"(CNN) -- All five remaining inmates held in the Mississippi pardons controversy have now been released from prison.

Mississippi's Supreme Court last week upheld the controversial pardons of more than 200 convicts that former Gov. Haley Barbour granted on his way out of office, rejecting a challenge by the state's attorney general.

In a 77-page, 6-3 ruling Thursday afternoon, the court found the pardons ""may not be set aside or voided by the judicial branch.""

Attorney General Jim Hood argued that no proper notice had been posted in newspapers, but the court found the final decision rested ""solely with the governor.""

""We are mindful that the victims and their families are entitled to be interested in the subject matter of this case, and they are undoubtedly -- and understandably -- concerned with its outcome,"" Justice Jess Dickinson wrote for the majority.

But in the cases before them, it was up to the governor to "" decide whether the Constitution's publication requirement was met.""

In a statement after the court ruling, Barbour said it ""reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state,"" but acknowledged that his decision has been difficult for many of the inmates' victims.

But in a dissenting opinion, Justice Michael Randolph called the decision ""a stunning victory for some lawless convicted felons, and an immeasurable loss for the law-abiding citizens of our state.""

Hood argued that the state Constitution required that for a pardon to be valid, notices be filed, each day, for 30 days in newspapers where their crimes were committed.

But during a February Supreme Court hearing, Barbour's lawyers argued that previous state court rulings had found the 30-day notice rule was ""an unconstitutional encroachment"" on the governor's power.

Thursday's ruling is the final word on the case, but Hood said he would seek to get the notice requirement restored to the state charter.

""We do respect the decision of the Court, but feel deeply for how it must weigh on the victims and their families. It is these victims and family members who have lost today and the criminals who have won,"" he said in a statement, echoing Randolph's dissent.

Among the 214 inmates Barbour pardoned before he left office in January were four convicted murderers who had worked as ""trusties"" at the governor's mansion. Critics argued that the governor failed to consider the families of their victims before freeing them.

All four and an armed robber also pardoned by Barbour had remained free while the issue worked its way through the courts, and were freed under Thursday's decision. Five other inmates who had remained behind bars awaiting a ruling have been released.

Barbour has defended his pardons and said the former inmates had been rehabilitated.

CNN's Martin Savidge and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.

53,"(CNN) -- London's Metropolitan Police have praised the good behavior of Scotland fans during Sunday's match against Brazil, despite claims by Brazilian striker Neymar that a banana was thrown at him as a form of racist abuse.

Santos striker Neymar, 19, scored both goals in Brazil's 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium, the home of English Premier League side Arsenal.

But the Brazilian attacker later revealed that he was subjected to racist taunts from Scottish spectators, which culminated in the banana-throwing incident.

However, the police confirmed they had received no complaints about any form of racism being displayed during the match on Monday.

Will Neymar win 2014 World Cup for Brazil?

Match commander, Chief Inspector Mark Shearan, issued an official press release which read: ""The Scottish supporters who travelled down to the game in their numbers were friendly and good-natured, colourful and supportive of their team.

""There were six arrests at the match -- of which only two were definitely Scottish supporters and were drink-related. This figure must be the seen in the context of a 53,000 strong crowd.""

After his two-goal winning performance, Neymar had earlier claimed to Brazilian media that he had been the subject of racist abuse: ""This atmosphere of racism is totally sad.

""They were jeering me a lot, even when I was about to kick the penalty the entire stadium was jeering.

""We leave our country to play here and something like this happens. It's sad. I would rather not even talk about it, to keep the subject from escalating.""

Neymar's teammate Lucas Leiva, who plays in England for Liverpool and removed the banana from the pitch, added: ""There is no more space for racism in the world.

""Europe is where it happens the most. That has to change, everybody is equal today and it's a matter of respect.""

The Scottish Football Association (SFA), in a statement on their official website, denied the claims from Neymar. ""There was no evidence of such instances but the Scotland supporters have confirmed they booed the player for perceived unsporting behaviour during the match.

""The tens of thousands of Scotland fans who travelled to London were, in fact, commended for creating a carnival atmosphere not just inside the stadium but across the city throughout the weekend.

""The Scottish FA has contacted the Brazilian Football Federation and the match organisers, Kentaro, to inform them of our information and of our supporters' unhappiness at the unfounded accusations,"" the statement read.

54,"He says it's his last fight. And it's been his hardest.

After 43 years in Congress, New York Rep. Charlie Rangel said the campaign for his 23rd term is his final one.

The 84-year-old ""Lion of Harlem"" wants two more years in Washington, but on Tuesday, voters will decide if his time is up.

He's a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and the former chair of the powerful Ways and Means Committee.

But the legend of Harlem politics is on shaky ground.

Rangel running for 23rd term in the House

Rangel says he's ready this time

He's been bruised before. In the 2012 Democratic primary, victory came by a thin margin. Rangel beat state Sen. Adriano Espaillat by fewer than 1,100 votes.

The congressman said he didn't put up much of a fight.

""I didn't have a campaign last time. When he told me he was running I was in the hospital in Columbia Presbyterian with a viral infection in my spine.""

This time, Rangel said he's ready.

""Well, I don't have a walker. I don't have a spinal injury.""

Rangel has also had more time to recover from a humiliating censure in 2010 from the U.S. House of Representatives following a series of ethics violations.

2014 midterms: What's at stake

Gearing up for Round 2

Since 2012,  Espaillat has been gearing up for Round 2. This time, the underdog said he's counting on an upset and making comparisons to one of the biggest ones ever in boxing:

""Sonny Liston was a big, bad bear when he got into the ring, but (Muhammad) Ali was faster, smarter than him,"" Espaillat said. ""He was able to draw circles around him, and he shook up the world and he changed boxing.""

If voters want a change now, it may be a measure of how much the district has changed since Rangel went to Washington in 1971.

Harlem's rich African-American history now seems distant

Neal Schumacher knows the streets of Harlem as well as anyone. He gives walking tours, and he often points out the fact that the neighborhood is, ""...not the Harlem that I grew up in, but a Harlem I embrace.""

A falling crime rate has accelerated real estate development in the neighborhood, but affordable housing remains among the most pressing issues for many with roots in the community.

""People are concerned about gentrification, about rising housing costs, about some of the mom and pop shops closing. About being able to afford to live in the community where you are now,"" said Schumacher.

Harlem has long been known for its rich African-American history. But to Harlem historian Jacob Morris, that past feels more distant today.

""In the 20th century Harlem was incontrovertibly...the cultural capital of Black America. ...Is it still? I would say now it's the custodian of that great history.""

Both say racial and ethnic politics not part of race

Today, the demographics are different. So is the district itself.

Part of the Bronx was added to Harlem's district before the 2012 primary. The 13th Congressional District now has a Hispanic majority.

If elected, Espaillat would become the country's first Dominican-American congressman.

Both candidates insist that racial and ethnic politics shouldn't determine the outcome of the race.

""We never had a political battle in my congressional district in 43 years based on where you were born or what religion you have,"" Rangel said while campaigning Saturday.

2014 midterms: Complete coverage

Turnout could be key

According to a NY1/Siena College poll released the week before the primary, the vast majority of voters said the race or ethnicity of the candidates makes no difference to them,

The same poll shows Rangel has a 70-point lead with blacks and a 5-point lead with whites, while Espaillat has a 24-point lead with Latinos. Overall, the poll gives Rangel a 13-point lead (47%-34%) against Espaillat.

Insiders suggest the race is tighter than that and too tough to predict.

A key factor: turnout is expected to be low. Both campaigns will have to battle to get voters to the polls on Tuesday. The congressional race is the only item on the ballot.

55,"(CNN) -- Investigators now say that, according to automated electronic connections attempts by the ACARS data reporting system of Malaysia Flight 370, the airplane flew far to the west, in an entirely different direction than it should have been heading as per its original flight-planned route, which was to the north.

The 90-degree turn to the west might have been purely random if entered by a nonpilot or inexpert pilot who knew simply how to turn a single knob (called the heading bug) that could command the autopilot to make a turn to a new heading (or direction).

There is strong evidence that this is not what happened.

Investigators now believe, according to news reports, that after its transponder and ACARS radio were turned off, turns were initiated at GPS waypoints. These waypoints are essentially virtual checkpoints in the sky, defining markers charted by airspace regulators that create pathways in the air that airplanes follow to keep safely separated from each other. The waypoints are defined by an exact latitude and longitude and can be located by a number of the airplane's various navigators, including GPS. If the reports of the flight path are true, it is not a route that could happen by accident.

There are two ways the 777-200 could have flown on this path. After passing one waypoint, it could have been directed to fly to the next waypoint by a pilot turning the heading knob toward that exact place, a process that would require some piloting expertise. This would be very unusual, and a novice or pilot without much flying experience on this plane would not know to make these kinds of inputs or have any conceivable reason to do so.

The almost certain explanation would be that these waypoints were programmed into the flight management system of the 777-200, a task that would have been beyond the abilities of anyone but a professional pilot. The autopilot follows the course put into the flight management system by the pilots. That is, when the autopilot is not being manually controlled instead. The manual control part is easy. You turn a knob and the airplane goes where you ask it to. The flight management system part is very complicated. I am a commercial pilot, and I have done some training on the Boeing 777. Even after a few hours of professional instruction I would have been unable to program the flight management system to command the autopilot to fly the flight plan that Flight 370 reportedly flew.

This leaves us with one of two possible conclusions. Either the flight was commandeered by a group with at least one professionally trained pilot among them or one of the pilots in control programmed the new off-route flight plan into the flight management system.

The latter would be far more likely. When terrorists hijacked the airplanes that were flown into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon, they flew the airplanes by hand and those hijackers had trained for months with that exact mission in mind. In the case of Flight 370, it would almost certainly have remained on autopilot, which would have dutifully followed the flight plan in the flight management system.

That flight plan was quite possibly entered for some mysterious reason by a trained pilot.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Goyer.

Not sure, but let's call it 2011, when Gwyneth Paltow made kale chips on TV with Ellen DeGeneres.

What's that got to do with a list of great veg eateries around the world?

We're not sure -- we just know that, like the rest of the world, we've been spending more time lately eating plants we'd never heard of when we were kids and seeking out an evolving supply of incredible vegetarian options while traveling.

From the world's only city with an all-vegan strip mall to those with large Hindu and Buddhist populations and a huge variety of options, the following vegetarian-friendly destinations have imaginative restaurants with cult-like followings.

Some of the cities on this list are obvious choices, while others, like Glasgow, Scotland, have only recently forayed in any significant way into vegetarian cuisine.

Here are our top 10 choices for herbivores who travel.

Portland, Oregon

From vegetarian/vegan-friendly bed-and-breakfasts to the world's only all-vegan strip mall, compassionate choices rule many establishments in this city.

We recommend: Natural Selection, the brainchild of California Culinary Academy graduate Aaron Woo.

With European-style decor and fare derived from France, Italy and Spain, this excellent restaurant serves dishes such as chard and mushroom gnocchi and caramelized cauliflower with polenta, using local vegetables and fruits at their seasonal peak.

The menu changes weekly.

Natural Selection, 3033 N.E. Alberta St., Portland, Oregon; +1 503 288 5883

New York

The chance of blindly stumbling into a vegetarian restaurant is probably higher in New York than in any other U.S. city.

While there's seemingly no end of diversity, from raw restaurants like Pure Food & Wine to farm-to-table Candle Cafe, our latest favorite is the amazingly creative Dirt Candy.

Yes, there's a wait to get a reservation -- the restaurant has only nine tables -- but we love the thoughtful, complex dishes and emphasis on a star ingredient per dish.

Dirt Candy, 430 E. Ninth St., New York; +1 212 228 7732

Chennai, India

As the ancient birthplace of vegetarianism, South India is largely vegetarian.

The states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu offer extremely spicy rice-based dishes and curries, while tiffin items like dosas, tamarind and lemon rice are common.

Vegetarian thalis (platters with a few curries, rice dishes and breads) cost less than a Starbucks latte.

We recommend: Madras restaurant for delicious South Indian home-style cooking.

Madras, Raintree Hotels, 636 Anna Salai, Teynampet, Chennai, India; +91 44 4393 9999

Chiang Mai, Thailand

Thanks to a large Buddhist population, Chiang Mai has more than 80 vegetarian restaurants.

Even those that aren't vegetarian-specific offer meatless tom yum soup, pad thai, salads and coconut-milk based curries.

We recommend: Pun Pun, which sources organic vegetables from its own farm. Curries are served on banana leaves.

Pun Pun has two locations in the city: Wat Suan Dok temple or Suthep Road near Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand; +66 81 470 1461

Glasgow, Scotland

It may come as a surprise to many that PETA named Glasgow the best city for vegans in the United Kingdom in 2013.

The growing number of vegan restaurants is part of the city's effort to improve the health of its residents and the result of its vibrant youth culture.

We recommend: Mono Cafe Bar in the Merchant City area.

The bar brews its own beer and offers a home-style meatless menu including refried bean burritos.

Music from folk singers, songwriters and the operatic crowd is a plus.

Mono Cafe Bar,12 Kings Court, Glasgow, Scotland; +44 141 553 2400

London

PETA ranked London the most vegetarian-friendly city in the world in 2009.

It's still a top site for meat-free eaters.

With more than 130 vegetarian-centric restaurants, spicy vegetarian curry houses are as plentiful as pubs offering fish and chips.

Nowadays, even pubs are serving meatless cuisine and raw food -- notable newcomer Redemption is an example.

We recommend: Arguably London's most well known vegetarian restaurant, Food for Thought in Covent Garden serves everything from Mexican to Indian dishes, cheese and dill scones to quiches.

The carefully chosen menu is inexpensive and satisfying.

Food for Thought, 31 Neal St., Covent Garden, London; +44 20 7836 0239

Seoul, South Korea

While it's best to double check with the server if there's any meat in the bibimbap, vegetarian dishes are common on Korean menus.

There's kimchi, of course, and a wide variety of veggie pancakes and side dishes, good news for any vegetarian visitor who may get dragged to a barbecue restaurant.

We recommend: Traditional Korean vegetarian restaurant Hangwachae in Seoul serves house-made condiments from chili paste to soy bean paste.

Even the rice is made with 20 different Asian herbs.

Hangwachae, Gwanhun-dong Jongno-gu, Seoul 30-9,  Cheong-A Building, B/1; +82 2 720 2802

Vancouver, British Columbia

In the last year or so, Vancouver has seen notable restaurants including the Heirloom, The Parker and The Acorn open to meet rising vegetarian demand.

We recommend: The Acorn, which received a Top Ten Best New Restaurants mention in En Route Magazine, the first vegetarian restaurant ever to snag the honor.

Vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free and raw junkies can sample a seasonal menu created with fruits and legumes from apples to Hen of the Woods.

The artfully composed dishes look like they belong in a museum.

The Acorn, 3995 Main St., Vancouver, British Columbia; +1 604 566 9001

Jordan

It's so easy to find vegetarian-friendly restaurants in Jordan where mezze dishes such as tabouleh, hummus, falafel and gourmet Arabic flatbreads abound.

From Beit Sitti (it means ""my grandmother's kitchen"" in Arabic), located in the heart of Amman, to Petra's Kitchen, there are good options at nearly every bend of the country.

We recommend: Feynan, an ecolodge in the heart of the mountainous Dana Biosphere Reserve.

In a candle-lit environment, visitors feast on flat breads baked by Bedouins, vegetarian stews, hibiscus juices, falafel, hummus and sticky knafeh for dessert.

Feynan, Dana Biosphere Reserve (western edge), off Dead Sea-Aqaba Highway, Ma'an, Jordan; +962 6 464 5580

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

A melting pot of cultures from China to India, Kuala Lumpur has more than 86 vegetarian-specific restaurants according to online healthy eating guide HappyCow.

Chinese, Malay and Indian cuisines are common.

We recommend: The inexpensive Gopala Vegetarian Restaurant, which features a potpourri of cultural cuisines from Thai to Indian.

The vegetarian satay and vegetarian fried rice earn raves.

57,"(CNN) -- Comprehensive immigration reform. Suddenly the phrase is on everyone's lips. From President Barack Obama to rising Republican star Sen. Marco Rubio to right-wing television hosts Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly. As if by magic, everybody's for it after six years of ducking and using reform as a political wedge issue -- everybody wants to get it done.

But what exactly is it? What kinds of changes will it entail, and what will they mean for America?

After more than 10 years of on-and-off debate in Washington, the most important piece of the puzzle is still rarely discussed and poorly understood. Obama often talks about reform without even mentioning it. It never came up on the campaign trail. It's not what brought Latinos out to vote in record numbers. And although it's likely to be included in the framework for reform expected to be released Monday by a bipartisan group of Senators, the concept gets very little attention from the media, English- or Spanish-language.

iReport: Under deportation, above fear

What's the most important piece of comprehensive immigration reform you never heard of? It's fixing the legal system so it works for the future -- for immigrants and the U.S. economy.

Many Americans think reform is about the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already living in the United States. Many have been here for years and have put down roots. We're not going to deport them -- not even the harshest restrictionists think that's practical.

Nor are most likely to go ""home"" voluntarily, no matter how difficult we make their lives with tough enforcement. For the overwhelming majority, America is home by now. And they are sure to be the most contentious issue when the immigration debate resumes in months to come.

News: Possible compromise on immigration reform takes shape

But most contentious is not the same as most important.

We all must ask: What created this problem in the first place? Exactly what is it about the broken immigration system that produced this vast underground world of workers and families -- a population the size of Ohio?

The root cause: For less-skilled foreigners who want to come to work legally in the United States, there is no ""line"" -- no available visas.

The two existing programs for low-skilled temporary workers are for seasonal labor only: farmhands, landscaping crews, summer and winter resort workers. And there are virtually no permanent visas to be had for unskilled workers. There simply is no avenue for an uneducated Mexican unless he has family members living legally in the U.S. who can sponsor him for a family visa.

Many, if not most, of the 11 million already here would have preferred to enter the country legally if that were possible. But they and others like them have no lawful option.

This wouldn't be a problem if we didn't need immigrant workers. But we do. And we're going to need them increasingly as the economy recovers.

This isn't because American workers are somehow lacking or inadequate. On the contrary, for the most part, it's because Americans are doing better than in decades past. We're becoming better educated and aspiring to the kinds of jobs for which our better educations prepare us.

News: GOP needs to back immigration overhaul, lawmakers say

In 1960, half of the native-born men in the labor force were high school dropouts happy to do physically demanding, low-skilled work. Today, less than 10% of the native-born men in the labor force are high school dropouts. And meanwhile, far from shrinking, the demand for low-skilled labor is growing over time. In 1955, for example, 25 cents of every dollar spent on food was spent in a restaurant. Today, the figure is nearly 50 cents. And one of the fastest-growing occupations in America is home health aide.

But very few Americans with high school diplomas aspire to careers as busboys or home health aides. And they shouldn't -- their educations equip them to do more productive work, making better wages and contributing more to the economy.

No, we don't need as many immigrant workers in a down economy -- and far fewer want to come to the U.S. when jobs are scarce. But we still need some, and they need a legal way to get here. And whatever program we create needs to be flexible, growing in good times to accommodate rising labor needs and shrinking back in down times when demand subsides.

Don't get me wrong: The goal of reform is not to increase the overall number of unskilled immigrants entering the country.

What's needed is to end illegal immigration by creating ways for needed workers to come legally -- creating worker visas and establishing a system that allows employers who can't find enough willing and able Americans to connect easily and quickly with lawful immigrants.

This is not just an economic imperative. Without it, there can be no successful immigration law enforcement.

Even the best, most effective enforcement is no match for the dynamism of the U.S. economy. As long as there are jobs available, foreigners will want to come to work here. And if we want to prevent them from coming illegally, we need to create lawful alternatives.

Finding a solution for the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already in the country addresses the mistakes of the past but fixes nothing going forward. Unless we create ways for the immigrants of the future to enter legally, we're going to find ourselves in exactly the same predicament a decade or two down the road -- wondering what to do about 10 or 20 million unauthorized immigrants living among us but beyond the rule of law.

The only way to prevent this: a legal immigration system that works.

Now if only Obama would mention it. Then we'd have some hope of getting somewhere as the debate resumes.

58,"(CNN) -- Hating the Internal Revenue Service is an American pastime that transcends political affiliation.

This past May, disgust for the IRS reached an all-time high when Lois Lerner, director of the IRS's Exempt Organizations unit, disclosed the agency had improperly targeted social welfare organizations seeking special status under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code based on their political ideology.

This revelation resulted in more than three months (and counting) of congressional hearings and investigations.

Read the IRS inspector general's report on targeting

But in typical Washington fashion, the manufactured congressional outrage and grandstanding has served to do little more than obfuscate the real scandal at the IRS: that the agency allows social welfare organizations to manipulate federal tax law by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on political ads.

Anyone who watched television in the lead-up to the 2010 and 2012 elections undoubtedly noticed the slew of vitriolic, misleading campaign ads. Some of these ads were sponsored by federal candidates, but many more were produced by groups with innocuous sounding names -- such as Crossroads GPS or the American Action Network -- but massive bank accounts. Crossroads GPS, for example, a nonprofit organization cofounded by former George W. Bush administration official Karl Rove, spent more than $70 million on the 2012 election.

Like the groups targeted by the IRS, Crossroads GPS is a section 501(c)(4) organization, which affords certain tax benefits and -- most importantly -- the ability to keep the names of donors secret. Federal law requires these groups to operate ""exclusively for purposes beneficial to the community as a whole."" IRS regulations, however, create a loophole in the law by allowing groups ""primarily"" engaged in these types of activities to benefit from this tax status. Many 501(c)(4) groups have interpreted this regulation to mean they can spend up to 49% of their funds on political activities -- mostly negative, deceptive political ads.

Adding to the confusion, the IRS has said there is no specific percentage the agency uses to gauge whether a group has engaged ""primarily"" in social welfare activities, but rather that it considers all facts and circumstances.

What does that mean exactly? No one knows.

When directly confronted about the problem and the agency's record of inaction, the IRS has said only that it is ""aware"" of the issue.

But the IRS has been aware of and has chosen to ignore this problem for more than 50 years.

If the agency had revised its regulations at any point in the past as my organization and others requested, the agency might have avoided the quagmire in which it is drowning. Frustrated with the IRS's inaction, in May CREW filed a lawsuit against the IRS for flouting the law barring 501(c)(4) organizations from engaging in political activity. The case is pending in District of Columbia district court. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and other public interest groups filed a similar lawsuit last month.

Because social welfare organizations are not required to disclose their donors, 501(c)(4) groups have become the de facto vehicle for millionaires, billionaires, and even corporations who want to remain anonymous while influencing our elections. As a result, politically active nonprofit groups spent more than $300 million on the 2012 election.

Americans should not only be outraged that our elections are being flooded with anonymous cash, but because of the nonprofit status of these groups, taxpayers are subsidizing their activity.

With more and more groups seeking to participate in federal elections using money raised from donors who want to remain anonymous, applications to the IRS for 501(c)(4) status more than doubled between 2010 and 2012. To manage the deluge, Lerner said the agency relied on code words and other shortcuts to single groups out for extra review.

While the scrutiny of tea party groups has received the most attention, the IRS ""Be on the Look Out"" (BOLO) list also included the words ""progressive,"" ""occupy,"" and ""Israel.""

Flagging any group for further screening because their applications included specific words or phrases was wrong.

The impact, however, of such misguided actions on our democracy was negligible, particularly compared to that wrought by the IRS's failure to stop hundreds of millions of dollars from flooding our electoral system to influence our votes.

For all of the abuse heaped upon the IRS and for all the concern about the BOLO list, the same thing could happen again if the disparity between the language of the statute and regulation is not addressed. Agents processing applications of groups seeking social welfare status in the future will remain as confused about the standards as those whose decisions have been questioned this year. Nevertheless, Congress has shown no appetite to pass legislation clarifying the requirements for these nonprofit groups.

As the 2014 election cycle gets under way, the super rich and corporations with deep coffers will continue to buy our elections, and Congress will continue to spend time and resources on a never-ending cycle of investigations into a problem with a fairly easy solution: as Congress intended when it first passed the law, prohibit 501(c)(4) organizations from spending money on anything other than social welfare activities.

As long as members of Congress do nothing other than one-up each other's disdain for the IRS, nothing will change.

And that really is a scandal.

59,"Why do their cheap meatballs taste so good?

Why can't store layouts be normal?

These questions, and more, will no doubt be posed by the visitors who head to the new IKEA Museum opening next year.

Of course, we might need to hammer together our own answers, having wound our way through thousands of irrelevant facts first.

But perhaps a DIY museum experience will be even more satisfying once completed.

The furniture company that changed the affordability of design has filed to build a museum on the site of its first store in Sweden.

Tentatively scheduled to open in fall 2015, the museum will take up 7,000 square meters on the site of the recently relocated IKEA store in Almhult, also the site of IKEA'S first store opened by founder Ingvar Kamprad in 1958.

IKEA town

Almhult is known as ""IKEA Town"" for being the birthplace of IKEA, which still maintains a strong corporate presence in the city.

While the then-17-year-old Kamprad had already registered IKEA as a business in 1943, selling products ranging from nylon stockings to cigarette lighters, the Almhult site was the first brick-and-mortar store as well as the company's first furniture showroom.

A small exhibition of IKEA's history, titled ""IKEA through the ages,"" is already in place at the basement of the corporate culture center in Älmhult, but company reps are hoping that the new museum will be a much bigger tourist draw.

""In the IKEA Museum we plan to tell the IKEA story, focusing on range, business and people development over time,"" said Michele Acuna, managing director for IKEA Tillsammans, the corporate culture center.

""We also plan to have a museum shop and food services for our visitors,"" said Acuna, adding that the museum is expected to draw ""roughly 200,000 visitors annually when it is in full steam.""

As of April 2014, there had been 28 face transplants across the world. Animal attacks, severe burns and gunshot wounds had left these recipients scarred for life, literally, in the one place their scars cannot be hidden -- their face.

""Anyone with this disfigurement would argue they're not living, they're surviving,"" says Luskin.

The first face transplant was performed in France in 2005 on Isabelle Dinoire, whose mouth, nose and chin had been chewed away by her dog. Since then the field has grown and transplants involving varying combinations of facial parts have been performed in six other countries, including the United States.

As the procedures improve and their safety grows, donor registries and collaborating hospitals will increasingly be asking the question: Would you like to donate your face? Or in the case of the UNOS approval, asking family members of potential donors the sensitive question of whether they will donate the face of their loved one.

The UNOS approval will initially be in place temporarily for 15 months to enable public comment, but families of donors will receive extra guidance when it comes to making the decision. ""Face transplants remain unique and require very specific criteria such as hairlines and ethnic components,"" explains a UNOS spokesperson. ""Therefore consent should be distinct and individual.""

""(This) will broaden the donor pool for wait-listed patients across a number of regional and national organ procurement organizations,"" explains Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez, professor of reconstructive plastic surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center. ""A major component for a successful procedure is patient selection on both the recipient and donor,"" he adds. ""The likeliness of a perfect match can be very challenging.""

But this once-experimental procedure is becoming more widespread and accepted. Richard Norris, from Virginia, received a new face in March 2012 and last month his face was featured on the cover of the U.S. edition of men's magazine GQ. Norris lost most of his facial features after a gun blast, and lost abilities such as his sense of smell. But after surgery at the hands of Rodriguez and his team he can live his life once again.

Face transplant patients: Where are they now?

Risk of rejection

However, as this mode of surgery becomes a norm, the side effects and risks that come with the life-changing operation are still a concern and a question of ethics.

Like any other transplant, there is a risk of the new organ being rejected by the patient's immune system and recipients have to take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives, putting them at risk of infections and cancer. But unlike many other transplants, replacing a face is not a matter of life and death. The surgery is classed by some as life-changing, not life-saving, which raises questions as to whether this risk is justified.

""For heart transplant patients they need a transplant or they will die. These (face transplant) patients are not in organ failure but are having to take anti-rejection medication and have lifelong repression,"" explains Dr. Maria Siemionow, from the University of Illinois, who performed a near-total face transplant in 2008 on American Connie Culp, who was shot in the face by her husband.

But Siemionow is working to solve this problem. ""We need new therapies which will be less harmful,"" she says.

The Polish surgeon is developing chimeric cells, which bring together the cells from a donor and the recipient during transplantation. ""We are fusing together cells from the bone marrow of donors and recipients so these cells will be recognized by the recipient's immune systems as their own,"" she explains. Not an easy task.

By combining the two cells and delivering them into patients receiving a transplant, their immune system will learn to recognize the donor's cells, which are present throughout their new face, making their immune cells less likely to attack the face.

""If the (immune system) can recognize more cells as 'self' the patient will need less anti-rejection drugs,"" says Siemionow, whose experimental therapy is hoped to enter clinical trials in a few years and when it does, may make face transplants more acceptable to critics.

""Immunosupression is the main ethical concern and new therapies are crucial for the future of this field,"" she says.

Luskin feels the benefits of a new face counter ethical doubts. ""There is no ethical issue,"" he concludes. ""I saw a patient walking down a crowded hospital hall a few years after surgery and no-one noticed them. He looked like a normal guy. To me, that's the point of these surgeries.""

61,"Call them drones; call them toy airplanes with digital cameras dropped into their girths.

Either way, South Korean defense officials said on Friday they were sure that they came from North Korea and that they were up to no good.

Three diminutive single-engine unmanned propeller planes that look like they could have come from a hobby shop were found on the ground in March and April in parts of the South near the border with the northern Communist regime.

Though the low-tech buzzers don't seem to represent a major danger, they come in the shadow of North Korean missile launches and the impending countdown to the test of a nuclear device.

And they made it through South Korean air defenses.

Ministry of National Defense officials in Seoul immediately suspected that the sky-blue colored fliers belonged to Pyongyang. They formed an investigation team with the United States in mid-April to analyze the ""travel log file"" and photos taken by the drones and announced the results on Friday.

Scientists found a ""smoking gun that all three were sent from North Korea and are programmed to return to North Korea,"" South Korean defense spokesman Kim Min-soek said.

Photos the drones took along on their journey corroborate their flight path, he said.

Precarious cargo

Had the mechanical carrier pigeons made it back home, they would have delivered precarious cargo, but it would have been far from precious.

Japanese-made digital cameras, which look like they could be of the consumer variety, were inserted into the bellies of the drones and had taken aerial photos of the South from around the border region.

All three were programmed to fly over military facilities, and two of them had images of targets of military interest -- strategically important islands near the demilitarized zone, and the Blue House, residence and office of South Korea's President Park Geun-hye.

Images from the third drone were not available to South Korean investigators. A wild ginseng digger had stumbled upon the plane and had deleted its memory card so he could use it himself, the Korea Times reported.

The planes were not capable of transmitting images back to North Korea in real time, and the photos themselves were no better than what one might see on a service akin to Google Earth, Kim said in a previous briefing.

Limited capabilities

There is little danger the drones could have made it far into South Korea.

The type of drone is not used for long-range missions, a defense analyst said. Instead they're better suited to see what the enemy is up to on the other side of a hill or wall.

""It has quite a small range, it doesn't have very long endurance so it would only be up there for a few hours. You would use those to see what the other guys are doing in a battlefield environment,"" said James Hardy, the Asia Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly magazine.

""They're very much closely built off a remote-controlled aircraft that you can buy in a toy store. They're just a militarized version of that,"" Hardy said.

The Korean drones are nowhere near as sophisticated as those used by the United States in Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan, he said.

They would also not make much of a weapon, if someone decided to stuff explosives into them, Kim has said.

""Even if they are to be used for future attacks, (they) can only carry 2-3 kilograms of TNT and cannot cause huge damage.""

North Korea has flaunted similar, larger UAVs at military parades in recent years, and some of them have been spiked with explosives, Hardy said.

Video footage shows North Korean exercises using them as missiles, but it's an expensive way to build a bomb, he said. And it could only take out a single vehicle or ship.

'Tis the season

Spring is traditionally a time of high tensions between Pyongyang on the one side and Seoul and Washington on the other.

Annual U.S.-South Korean joint military drills, that ended on April 7, drew criticism from North Korea, which views the exercises as ""dress rehearsals for invasion,"" according to analyst James Person from the Woodrow Wilson Center.

In March, Pyongyang fired two mid-range ballistics missiles off its eastern coast, in an apparent response to the drills. Days later, the two sides fired hundreds of shells across the Northern Limit Line, their disputed maritime border.

The shells were shot into the sea, not at hard targets.

North Korea also warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device.

""It's all good stuff because it allows the North Koreans to do something provocative and slightly annoying which might embarrass South Koreans, but it's not provocative enough to create a proper military response,"" Hardy said.

Slipping through

The drones would fit well into that category, since they slipped through South Korean air defenses.

They are made of polycarbonate, which is difficult to detect with radar, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.

They fly at an average speed of about 110 km per hour (68 mph) at an altitude of 1.3 km (.8 miles).

They were launched in North Korea from three locations, South Korea's defense ministry said: Near the Kaesong area, 27 kilometers southeast of Haeju and 17 kilometers from Pyonggak.

South Korea's defense ministry called the intrusion by the drones a violation of the truce that ended the bloody conflict between North and South Korea in 1953.

Kim said Seoul will send a warning via the United Nations to Pyongyang and tighten air defenses as a response to the drones.

62,"(CNN) -- Move over, Emma. There's a new queen in town.

Isabella dethroned Emma as the top name for girls born last year, according to the Social Security Administration's annual list of most popular baby names, released Saturday.

Jacob, on the other hand, held on as the most popular boy's name for the 11th year in a row.

The Social Security Administration started compiling name lists in 1997. And as in years past, the influence of pop culture is reflected in the names picked for newborns.

The boy's name that rocketed up the list the fastest is Cullen -- the name of the lead character in the popular ""Twilight"" book series.

Cullen's girlfriend in the books is Bella, short for Isabella.

On the girls' side, the fastest riser is Maliyah, an altered version of the name of President Obama's daughter Malia -- which also is among the top 10 fast risers.

But parents are equally quick to drop celebrity-inspired names once they think the popularity is passe.

Among the biggest drops last year were Mylee and Miley, as in singer Miley Cyrus.

Also on the outs: Lindsay and Jonas (think actress Lindsay Lohan and the band Jonas Brothers).

Meanwhile, Barack continued to move up the list. Sixty-nine Baracks were born in 2009, the agency said.

As always, religious names retained their popularity -- even if some were somewhat unconventional.

Among the popular names are Nevaeh (heaven spelled backward) for girls, and Messiah for boys.

The 10 most popular girls' names, in order, are: Isabella, Emma, Olivia, Sophia, Ava, Emily, Madison, Abigail, Chloe and Mia.

The 10 most popular boys' name, also in order, are: Jacob, Ethan, Michael, Alexander, William, Joshua, Daniel, Jayden, Noah and Anthony.

63,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Los Angeles fire officials say they're worried that nighttime winds could push two major wildfires, which already are blamed in two deaths, closer to pricey neighborhoods on the Pacific coast.

Fire draws near homes in the Los Angeles-area community of Porter Ranch, California, on Monday.

""We are concerned about what will happen tonight when the winds pick up,""  Los Angeles Fire Chief Douglas Barry said Monday.

California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger Monday declared a state of emergency Monday in Los Angeles and Ventura counties because of the fires.  Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, whose district covers the area where the fire is burning, called on President Bush to issue a federal disaster declaration for the area.

At least two people have died because of the blazes, which have burned 8,000 acres in the hills and mountains of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, fire and police officials said.

One was identified as a man who died in a makeshift wood-and-cardboard shelter and appeared to be homeless. A dog's body also was found.

The other victim was killed in a collision of motorists who were trying to exit a freeway that was closed because of one of the wildfires, a fire official said.

No identity or age was available for either victim.

""Winds are causing fire conditions to change by the hour,"" Schwarzenegger said in a statement released Monday. ""Several thousand acres have already burned with minimal containment and more acres are threatened."" iReport.com: Are wildfires affecting you?

Residents downwind were warned to remain alert into the night. ""It can go from here to the ocean in a matter of two to three hours,"" said Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, The Associated Press reported.

Barry said investigators have not determined a cause for either blaze.

Fire officials warned that strong winds, predicted to reach more than 60 mph after 11 p.m., could send fire roaring south down the Pacific coast near Highway 101.

Officials have shut two freeways north of Los Angeles and authorities dispatched water-dropping helicopters and more than 200 fire engines as the blaze ""started to push toward the city,"" said John Tripp of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.  About 350 police officers are on the scene, patrolling evacuated neighborhoods and warning residents ahead of the flames.

Officials shut down part of Interstate 210, also known as the Foothill Freeway, and any residents north of the freeway were under a mandatory evacuation order. The fire jumped the interstate in one spot and headed toward the Lake View Terrace area.

A portion of State Route 118, known as the Ronald Reagan Freeway, also was closed.

The larger of the two fires has charred more than 3,500 acres in the Angeles National Forest, officials said.  See video of the Angeles National Forest fire »

That fire destroyed several structures, including about 30 mobile homes in the Lopez Canyon area, said Los Angeles County fire inspector Sam Padilla. The mobile homes had been evacuated Sunday.

The other fire, burning nearby, is expected to expand as the winds push the flames away from the center.

In San Diego County, a wildfire that began on an explosives training range at Camp Pendleton had grown to more than 1,500 acres by nightfall and forced the evacuation of 1,400 homes, The AP reported.

In northern California, a wildfire that started Sunday on Angel Island in San Francisco Bay had spread across 250 acres as of Monday morning but hadn't damaged any buildings in the historic state park, a Marin County fire official said.  See video of the Angel Island fire »

64,"(CNN) -- In September 1985 a devastating earthquake measuring 8.1 on the Richter Scale smashed into Mexico City killing 10,000 people and leaving parts of the city in ruins.

Since then, the populous Latin American nation of 122 million has invested in one of the most advanced seismic warning systems anywhere in the world.

The SASMEX facility came online in 1991 and reacts to data gathered by sensors placed near major fault lines along Mexico's Pacific coast.

Receivers dotted around five major cities, including Mexico City and Acapulco, will sound the alarm if they detect an earthquake.

It's a system that can buy vital seconds for residents to brace themselves before the tremors begin.

But not everyone has access to a SASMEX receiver -- there are 100,000 in operation but at a cost of roughly $330 apiece, they are a luxury the majority of Mexicans can't afford.

Most receivers are stationed in the likes of public buildings, hospitals, schools and subway stations.

With roughly 21 million people living both formally and informally in and around Mexico City alone, that means many will not be aware the alarm is sounding until the ground begins shaking.

$50 alarm

According to local tech entrepreneur, Andres Meira, such vital services should be far more widely available.

Meira is no passive observer in this debate. He moved to Mexico City after working in Haiti and witnessing the devastation caused by the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck the Caribbean island in 2010 killing more than 230,000 people.

It's an experience that had a profound and lasting effect on him.

""Until you live in one of these places you don't really understand the primitive fear of earthquakes,"" he said. ""There are times when you can't sleep and sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night and make sure things aren't moving.""

Now, after combining with local engineers and tech investors based in Silicon Valley, Meira believes he may have a solution that will bring the SASMEX signal to the masses.

It's called the Grillo (the Spanish word for cricket) early warning system. The compact device -- a cube about the size of an alarm clock -- taps into the special frequencies that SASMEX operates on and relays that information to its users.

When seismic activity is detected, the Grillo sounds a loud, flashing alarm. At a cost of just $50, it also undercuts the price of the receivers used primarily in public buildings by around 85%.

""This is the most affordable and the most direct way for the Mexican public to connect to the early warning system,"" Meira says of the product, which also became Mexico's most successful ever Kickstarter campaign.

Mexico City's geographic location and geological makeup put it at particular risk from seismic activity. There have been a handful of relatively small quakes in 2014 already.

Meira also hopes versions of the Grillo system could be introduced elsewhere in the world where earthquakes are a real risk -- like in Nepal, India, the West Coast of the U.S. and along much of the Pacific Coast of South America.

Missing education?

But others point to the difficulty of introducing a mass warning system without first educating citizens on what to do when receiving a direct alert.

Speaking to McClatchyDC.com earlier this year, Arturo Iglesias Mendoza, director of the Institute of Geophysics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, pondered what would happen if 5,000 of 60,000 people in a football stadium received an alert of an imminent earthquake? ""People should know that the safest thing to do is to stay in the stadium,"" he said.

On top of that, the $50 price is still a considerable investment for many residents of a country where the average wage remains under $5 a day.

Then there is the fact that only a handful of early warning systems like SASMEX exist anywhere in the world. This means that Grillo will unlikely have government sourced data and advanced sensor system set up near major fault lines to tap into in many other locations.

Meira and his colleagues have anticipated such difficulties.

He speaks of the next stage of the Grillo project which will see hundreds of specially developed sensors placed all over Mexico, feeding into an algorithm that will provide early-warning alerts to apps and smartphones.

Warning app

Known as Grillo Active, the tiny orange devices contain a sensitive movement detector, microprocessor and a WiFi module to transmit a signal. Grillo are currently in talks with a major convenience store chain to locate the devices at between 500 and 1,000 of their stores around Mexico.

Such a wide spread will ensure more reliable and faster alerts.

""The real test of a good infrastructure is the density of sensors,"" Meira said. ""This is our plan in Mexico.""

Given that the devices can be produced cheaply and located anywhere with an internet connection, the potential for Grillo to be used in a variety of vulnerable areas around the world is very real.

Japan remains the only nation in the world where the entire country is hooked up to an early warning facility. And that system, which consists of 1,000 GPS sensors.

For now, however, this fledgling group's focus remains on Mexico.

The first small batch of Grillo boxes produced have been sold, although they haven't yet seen any action in the field. Mexico's last earthquake was recorded about six months ago, when the device was still in the prototype phase.

Meira hopes that the acid test doesn't come too soon, but he expects a solid performance from his invention when it does.

""The science is all there,"" he said. ""We have tested it out in two earthquakes and they worked just fine. One was a seven pointer (on the Richter scale) and it worked perfectly.""

Now, they await the next earthquake.

65,"Coral Gables, Florida (CNN)Former President Bill Clinton on Saturday defended his family foundation's practice of taking money from foreign countries, arguing that while he doesn't agree with all of the policies of countries that contributed, he feels the foundation has ""done a lot more good than harm.""

The Clinton Foundation admitted last month that a 2010 donation from the Algerian government was not properly approved under the guidelines the Obama administration put in place with the foundation when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009. Bill Clinton defended the donations as something that went to worthwhile projects.

""The UAE [United Arab Emirates] gave us money. Do we agree with everything they do? No. But they are helping us fight ISIS and they built a great university with NYU open to people around the world,"" Clinton said at a foundation event in Florida. ""Do I agree with all the foreign policy of Saudi Arabia? No.""

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman are among the countries that donated to the Clinton Foundation.

Clinton continued: ""You've got to decide when you do this work, whether it will do more good than harm if someone helps you from another country. ... I believe we have done a lot more good than harm.""

The story became a controversy for the Clintons, one where even some Democrats questioned the practice. Hillary Clinton is the party's presidential frontrunner in 2016 and is expected to announce her presidential aspirations next month.

Republicans jumped on board the story, too, using it to question the Clintons' ethics and whether, as president, she would give preferential treatment to countries that have donated to the foundation.

Democrats that did publicly defend the Clintons noted that the foundation disclosed all of their donation on their website. On Saturday, Clinton did the same.

""My theory about all this is disclose everything. And then let people make their judgments,"" Clinton said. ""I'm going to tell you who gave us money and you can make your own decisions.""

Clinton concluded his defense of the foundation, stating that he thinks organizations should ""bring people together across great divides, around things that they can agree on and find something to do to make peoples lives better.""

The Clinton Foundation was founded by Bill Clinton after he left the presidency in 2001. To date, the foundation has raised over $2 billion that goes toward a wide variety of projects, including health and wellness, economic development and leveling the playing field for women and girls.

Many of their projects focus on international issues, such as rebuilding Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and providing access to low-cost HIV and AIDS treatment. Those were primarily the projects backed by foreign countries.

The former president's comments were the only moment any Clinton mentioned the foreign fundraising controversy. Neither Hillary or Chelsea Clinton mentioned the issue.

At no point Saturday did any of the Clintons address the fact that Hillary Clinton exclusively used a private email account for the four years she served as America's top diplomat, a practice that skirted legal standards in place.

The former secretary of state spent 18 minutes on stage Saturday and didn't mention question about her email, instead focusing on the foundation and a new report they will put out on women and girls participation.

That didn't bother the over 1,000 overachieving millennials at the Clinton Global Initiative University meeting who couldn't have cared less about the swirling email and fundraising controversies that have defined the Clintons the last few weeks.

Saturday's event is the university-focused branch of the Clinton Foundation. It brings philanthropic minded students from around the world together to talk about their projects and pitch the foundation for funding.

This year brought together students looking to do a wide variety of things, from increasing women's inclusion in science and math fields to harvesting potable water from fog. In total, the foundation will hand out $900,000 to the different students.

The general sense among the event attendees was: ""What controversies?""

""I am here for me. I am here for learning, exploring, meeting new people and expanding my knowledge about nonprofit management and social change,"" said Armel Arnaud Nibasumba, a Middlebury College student born and raised in Burundi. ""I don't really care if they address those political issues that are going on.""

A few students, including Victoria Arild from Menlo College, said they hadn't heard of the controversies.

""I am here because my college, I had the privilege of them funding me,"" she said, before shrugging off questions about the email issues.

66,"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich's record winning start to the Bundesliga season came to an abrupt end Sunday as they were stunned 2-1 at home by Bayer Leverkusen.

Going into the match at the Allianz Arena, Bayern had racked up eight straight wins, but a late own goal by their German international defender Jerome Boateng saw them slip to defeat.

They still have a four-point lead at the top from Schalke, while Leverkusen have moved up to fifth.

The visitors took the lead when Andre Schuerrle left striker Stefan Kiessling with a close range tap-in after 42 minutes.

Bayern drew level with 13 minutes remaining as striker Mario Mandzukic headed home, but Leverkusen were to enjoy their first win in Munich since 1989.

Boateng's attempted to head away a shot but it just flew past goalkeeper Manuel Neuer on 86 minutes.

In other action, Eintracht Frankfurt missed the chance to move back above Schalke when they lost 2-1 at Stuttgart.

Snow can't stop Dortmund victory

Vedad Ibisevic scored Stuttgart's winner for the second straight week. Alexander Meier had leveled for Frankfurt after Christian Gentner's sixth-minute opener for the home side .

Borussia Moenchengladbach came from two down to score three late goals in a 3-2 win at Hanover.

In Serie A, champions Juventus maintained their lead at the top with a controversial 1-0 win at Catania, who finished with 10 men.

Chilean star Arturo Vidal put Juve ahead after 57 minutes before Catania defender Giovanni Marchese was sent off mid-way through the second half.

But the real arguments came in the first half as Catania thought they had gone ahead when Argentine striker Ruben Bergessio tapped home a rebound.

The referee ruled it out to the fury of the home side and their president Antonino Pulvirenti, who was sent from the bench for dissent.

Inter Milan kept up their pursuit of the Old Lady with their fifth straight win, 3-2 at Bologna to stay four points behind.

Andrea Ranocchia and Diego Milito put Inter 2-0 ahead before Nicolo Cherubin hit back for the home side.

Esteban Cambiasso's first goal of the season sealed three points for the Nerazzurri.

In La Liga, Atletico Madrid drew level on points with Barcelona at the top as man of the moment Radamel Falcao scored his 10th league goal of the season in their 3-1 win over Osasuna.

Joao Miranda and Raul Garcia put Atletico 2-0 ahead in the Vincente Calderon Stadium before Roland Lamah pulled one back for Osasuna, who stay bottom of the table.

Falcao sealed the three points 17 minutes from time.

In the late match, reigning champions Real Madrid won 5-0 in Mallorca with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuain both scoring twice.

But they remained eight points adrift of the leading pair in fourth place.

1. ""Orphan Black,"" 9 p.m. ET, Saturday, April 18, BBC America

The cloning cult sci-fi series remains one of the most critically acclaimed shows on TV, thanks in large part to the performance of Tatiana Maslany, who has taken on at least six roles on the show so far, including a newly introduced transgender clone.

Maslany told reporters this week that we can expect even more impressive scenes with multiple clones.

""We like to push the boundaries of what we're able to do and the limits of those clone scenes,"" she said.

""So, yes, you'll definitely see more complex clone work this season and that's just because we're getting more comfortable with the technology and we're excited by getting to sort of further complicate things.""

And the introduction of a group of male clones will certainly increase the suspense.

""There definitely is a shift towards the Castor clones that we get to explore them a little bit more,"" she said.

The fans of the show, dubbed the ""Clone Club"" have a lot to look forward to when the show premieres on Saturday the 18th, and Maslany is blown away by the response to the series so far.

""We've always been really humbled and really inspired by our fans and by their dedication to the show and their knowledge of the show, and  just how it changes their own lives. It's incredible.""

68,"Washington (CNN) -- In one ill-fated fundraiser, Mitt Romney managed to offend Palestinians, Latinos and some of the same people he's counting on for support if he wants to unseat President Barack Obama.

It isn't the first time Romney's oratory fumbles have put his campaign on its heels, handed opponents material to push the stereotype of him as an out-of-touch businessman and provoked members of the party's conservative base to question his worthiness as their standard-bearer.

""Everybody has the same reaction: 'dumb, dumb, dumb,'"" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, adding that Romney's gaffes reinforce a sitcom-like caricature of the candidate.

Opinion: What's wrong with Romney

After the tape, recorded during a May 17 private fundraiser at the home of Sun Capital executive Marc Leder, made the rounds on Monday, Romney convened a hastily scheduled news conference Monday night in which he said his comments were ""off the cuff"" and ""not elegantly stated.""

However, he defended the main message of his remarks, saying he that while he could have made them ""more clearly,"" he said he was trying to point out the differences between his and Obama's campaigns.

Democratic pundits gloated and were content to let Romney's words speak for themselves.

""I mean, I don't think Democrats had much to say at all. I mean, there wasn't much left to say,"" Democratic strategist Richard Socarides said on CNN's ""Early Start."" ""Look, I mean, I think that, you know, big picture, this is a -- was a devastating moment for Governor Romney, potentially fatal, as people start to focus on this campaign.""

Narratives at work

Another Democratic strategist said that Romney's comments played into the two narratives that they have pushed: ""First, that he doesn't care about the middle class. Well, thanks for the help, Mitt,"" Paul Begala, a CNN contributor and a senior adviser in the leading pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, said on CNN's ""AC360.""

""On the second front ... in order to give big tax cuts for the rich, Mitt Romney is going to have to raise taxes on the middle class. Well, when you're claiming to wealthy people that 47 percent of Americans don't pay federal income tax, I think a lot of those people, retirees, working class folks are going to listen to that and think, 'Gee, I guess the Democrats are right. I guess he does want to raise the taxes on the middle class in order to help the rich.'""

Republican strategist Margaret Hoover, who served in the Bush White House, said the comments would wound Romney but it wouldn't be a fatal one.

""You can understand while he tripped over his words, it probably wasn't characterized the best way. I think we can all agree with that,"" she said on ""Early Start."" ""You can understand what he was trying to say. Do we have a systemic problem in this country when you have almost 50 percent of people not paying any federal income taxes? And he's running on a platform that would fundamentally change the tax code so that you lower the base, broaden the base and lower tax rates across the board.""

Reaction from other conservatives was mixed. While some some applauded Romney's comments, others saw them as reinforcing why they questioned his legitimacy.

CNN contributor and conservative blogger Erick Erickson tweeted: ""Dammit! I'm just now seeing these Romney secret videos. We need that guy on the campaign trail!""

Others, such as New York Times columnist, David Brooks, wrote ""Romney's comment is a country-club fantasy. It's what self-satisfied millionaires say to each other. It reinforces every negative view people have about Romney.""

And conservative commentator Bill Kristol, a frequent critic of Romney, called the remarks ""stupid and arrogant.""

""It's worth recalling that a good chunk of the 47 percent who don't pay income taxes are Romney supporters â€” especially of course seniors (who might well ""believe they are entitled to heath care,"" a position Romney agrees with), as well as many lower-income Americans (including men and women serving in the military) who think conservative policies are better for the country even if they're not getting a tax cut under the Romney plan. So Romney seems to have contempt not just for the Democrats who oppose him, but for tens of millions who intend to vote for him,"" Kristol posted on The Weekly Standard on Tuesday.

Romney campaign responds

A Romney adviser tried to put the comments in context:

""What he's saying is there are people out there who don't pay taxes, unfortunately,"" Bay Buchanan, a senior adviser, said on CNN's ""Starting Point"" on Tuesday. ""They're in a position where they're dependent on government, and those individuals are -- those Americans are voting for Barack Obama. They're in his backyard. And so those are people that I'm not going to be able to reach with my 20 percent tax cut or my cuts in spending because they would be concerned. It's not going to impact them getting a 20 percent tax cut. They don't pay taxes.""

Romney's comments were recorded by a hidden camera and posted Monday afternoon on the left-leaning news websites Mother Jones and The Huffington Post.

Romney argued nearly half of Americans will vote for Obama because they rely on government support.

Adding to his argument about entitlement, Romney said his ""job is not to worry about those people.""

He also joked about wishing he had Latino heritage and talks about a Chinese factory his former firm purchased.

A clip released Tuesday morning showed Romney questioning the prospect of ever reaching peace between Israelis and Palestinians, calling a path to a solution in the region ""almost unthinkable to accomplish.""

""I'm torn by two perspectives in this regard,"" Romney is shown saying in a clip that only shows only the candidate speaking and does not include any questions that may have prompted his remarks. ""One is the one which I've had for some time, which is that the Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace, and that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish.""

Opinion: How Romney really feels about the GOP

With two weeks until the first presidential debate and less than two months before the election, the timing couldn't be worse, political experts say.

The Romney campaign had banked on its convention last month to make a favorable introduction of Romney to the electorate, a large part of it just beginning to pay attention to the election. But a CNN/ORC International poll conducted after the convention showed Romney gained only a 1% rise in the polls while Obama gained three to four times that much following the Democrats' convention.

Romney's acceptance speech was largely overshadowed by a rambling, off-the-cuff monologue by actor Clint Eastwood, which preceded it.

Last week, Romney was criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for an aggressive and politically charged response to violent attacks on U.S. embassies in Egypt and Libya. After the attacks, Romney in a statement said, ""It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.""

Series of gaffes

Over the weekend, Politico posted a story that detailed tensions within Romney's campaign and on Monday the campaign launched a new effort to inject energy and fresh policy details with a series of speeches and advertising.

""There's been a bit of bad luck involved in some of it,"" said John Geer, chairman of Vanderbilt University's political science department. ""It's not a surprise that these blunt remarks are going to be made in front of this type of audience. Here's a guy who's trying to work on his image about caring and this doesn't help him at all.""

Romney has been plagued by a series of gaffes during his presidential run.

He joked with unemployed workers in Florida in June 2011 that he, too, was also unemployed.

In January of this year, he told a crowd of supporters that he likes ""being able to fire people"" in a talk about insurance companies. He went on to say that if someone didn't provide adequate services, he liked to be able to find someone else who would. But critics took the first part of the quote used it to paint him as a venture capitalist focused only on a company's bottom line.

Controversial video shows candid Romney

In a February interview, Romney told CNN that he is ""not concerned about the very poor,"" citing the safety net in place by the American government and said that his primary focus is the middle class. But it was the first part of the sentence that critics pounced on as evidence of Romney's elitism, while conservatives said the safety net he talked about only encouraged a welfare state.

Later that month, at a campaign stop at the Daytona 500 NASCAR race, Romney told a reporter that while he might not follow the sport as closely as the most ardent fans, ""I have some great friends who are NASCAR team owners.""

And at an event in Detroit, he tried to prove he was behind the American automotive industry by saying that he drove a Ford Mustang and a Chevrolet pickup and that his wife, Ann, ""drives a couple of Cadillacs.""

Defenders sought to defuse the controversy by pointing to Obama's comments during the 2008 Democratic primaries about ""bitter"" people who ""cling to guns or religion.""

But those comments came long before the general election and did little to harm him with voters.

Romney's comments will serve as a distraction in coming days but there's still opportunities for him to get back on track with a weak economy and high jobless rate.

""He's a tough campaigner Romney. ... I don't think one should rule him out,"" Geer said. ""The fundamentals are still a problem for Obama.""

69,"(CNN) -- As the world knows, peace can sometimes be fleeting.

One-time basketball bad boy Ron Artest, who changed his name to Metta World Peace and said it was meaningful and inspirational, was ejected Sunday from the Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game for hitting James Harden in the head with his elbow.

After scoring against the Thunder in the second quarter, World Peace was cheering his own shot when he hit the Oklahoma City guard in the back of the head, knocking him down.

Watch the NBA.com video of the hit

Harden was on the floor for several minutes, and did not return to the game after being diagnosed with a concussion, according to the Thunder.

World Peace was ejected from the game and faces possible suspension. The Lakers won 114-106 over the Thunder in double overtime.

""During that play I just dunked on (Kevin Durant) and (Serge) Ibaka, and I got really emotional and excited. It was unfortunate that James had to get hit with an unintentional elbow,"" World Peace told reporters after the game.

""I hope he's OK. The Thunder, they're playing for a championship this year, so I hope that he's OK and I apologize to the Thunder and to James Harden,"" he said.

Hours later, World Peace tweeted that he watched the replay again: ""Oooo .. My celebration of the dunk really was too much ... Didn't even see James ... Omg... Looks bad.""

Harden told ABC's Lisa Salters he had ""a little bit of a headache.""

On Monday, the Thunder said Harden was undergoing testing.

""Harden participated in a series of limited activities per NBA guidelines, but has additional steps that must be taken under the league-mandated concussion policy before he can make his return to the court,"" the team statement said. ""He will be re-evaluated tomorrow and is currently listed as day-to-day.""

World Peace's act was called ""disgraceful"" by game commentators, and sports analysts said the behavior was reminiscent of the ball player they once knew as Ron Artest.

""He has gone to such lengths to rehabilitate his image, and to revert back to this? He lost control,"" said Michael Wilbon, an ESPN analyst.

Sports fans were baffled, some even amused, when World Peace announced last year that he planned to legally change his name from Ron Artest.

""Ron Artest has contemplated the name change for years and always knew that he wanted his last name to be World Peace. But it took many years of research and soul searching to find a first name that was both personally meaningful and inspirational,"" his publicist said at the time.

Back when World Peace was still Artest and playing for the Indiana Pacers, he made headlines in 2004 for his role in a brawl between players and fans at a Pacers-Pistons game after somebody threw a drink on him.

The NBA suspended Artest for 86 games.

Fast forward to September 2011, when Artest announced the name change.

Even before it was finalized by the court, World Peace was working on making the world a more peaceful place.

In 2011, he raffled off his 2010 NBA Championship ring to help mentally ill youths. For his work with the youth, he was given the NBA's citizenship award for philanthropic work.

A star turn on ""Dancing With the Stars"" garnered the basketball player a new legion of fans.

But in the world, peace sometimes comes with a price: The NBA is now reviewing World Peace's less than peaceable actions.

70,"(CNN) -- Over the past few weeks almost a third of all Americans headed back to classrooms -- from early learning centers to universities, as students and as teachers -- accompanied by the usual seasonal mix of joys and jitters. Or perhaps not.

Lately it seems we've been inundated with bad news: The nation's report card is crummy; schools are broke and failing; graduates can't find jobs. And with competition for resources putting increased pressure on standardized test scores, cheating scandals have become practically ho-hum. Among all these headlines resides a more quietly sobering fact: This year's high school graduates will be the first educated entirely under the No Child Left Behind Act.

In other words, a whole generation of kids who've grown up with an emphasis on multiple choice testing, who've been taught that knowing the one right answer is more important than the process of inquiry, who've learned that admitting ""I don't know"" is a crime.

But the problem isn't simply with a narrowly conceived educational policy. Pressure to know the right answer (or, more precisely, to appear to know) isn't limited to the classroom. It's pervasive throughout our culture -- a reality at once daunting and hopeful. Daunting because it means real reform will require more widespread change. Hopeful because it means there's something every one of us can do about it. Maybe even starting today.

I'm talking about breaking the habit of faking knowledge in order to save face. For most of us, the fear of not knowing -- of looking dumb -- gets ingrained when we're small and reinforced throughout life in ways both subtle and overt.

For every time someone reassured us, ""There's no such thing as a stupid question,"" weren't there ample experiences -- on the playground, at the dinner table, and yes, in the classroom -- that convinced us otherwise?

Anyone who's ever been reprimanded or ridiculed for revealing ignorance knows all too well: The taste of shame is bitter and lingering. We'll go to great lengths to avoid it, often without deliberate thought.

How many times have I found myself nodding in feigned recognition when someone makes reference to a person or book they assume I know? How many times have I been guilty of unwittingly inflicting similar discomfort on others?

In some walks of life, presenting a knowing demeanor is practically a job requirement. One financial adviser recalls how, early in his career, he was so anxious to impress upon his clients that he knew was he was doing, he'd use meetings to ""information dump"" -- only subsequently learning that they'd been too embarrassed to speak up and confess they had no idea what he was talking about.

A surgeon tells about the time when, as a new intern, afraid to admit unfamiliarity with a procedure and ask questions, she plunged in confidently -- and made an incision four times longer than the patient had been told the scar would be. Politicians routinely face shame if they confess to not knowing.

Remember Rick Perry's memory lapse during the 2011 Republican primary debate? It seems we'll forgive our elected officials just about any breach of ethics, but let them admit to anything less than invulnerable certainty and they can kiss our vote goodbye.

For the past several years, I've made a conscious effort to be candid about the limits of my own knowledge. As a college teacher, I've discussed this intention explicitly with students and colleagues.

Guess what? I'm mortified to report: Despite my public resolution to practice this most essential form of academic integrity, I still catch myself engaging in a kind of knee-jerk, face-saving, passive dissimulation on a semi-regular basis. Based on what I hear from others, I'm not alone. Such behavior is apparently endemic.

So what are we to do?

For starters, talk about it. Own up to instances when we faked knowledge. Initiate conversations about what makes us more or less susceptible to this behavior. You're likely to hear some funny stories, and the experience of shared vulnerability is humanizing and makes for closer connections. Best of all, it creates an environment in which all stand to grow.

My friend Lori, during her years as a high school history teacher, constantly encouraged her students to play in the wide-open spaces of uncertainty. One way she did this was by sharing her own gaps in knowledge. She'd model not just her comfort with not having figured everything out, but her delight in it. This, she seemed to convey, was where real intellectual pleasure lay: in the adventure of exploring the unknown. Often she'd assign Shakespeare as a way of getting students to think about power and status. She'd have them read one of the plays, then ask: ""Who's more powerful in this scene?""

Her students, anxious to deliver the ""right"" answer, would demand clarification. ""What do you mean? Powerful how?""

Lori would shrug and unfurl her fingers: Nothing up my sleeves. This isn't a trick. If her students protested, she'd say simply, ""That's all I know.""

And so they'd be forced to grapple not only with the answer to her question, but with the meaning of her question, with the definition of power in the first place, which she, the authority figure, had just handed over to them: You guys figure it out. You decide. In this way, they were learning about history and drama but also about shifts in power, and who may wield it, and how classrooms can work and how societies can work, and about the very nature of ""right"" answers as opposed to the illimitable richness of interrogating the questions.

This is what excites me when I think of heading back to school this fall: the prospect of bringing such generous, generative energy into the classroom. Perhaps filling in the ovals with number two pencils is important for helping us understand how far we are from achieving equity in schools across the nation. That is a vital project, deserving urgent attention. But we won't ever achieve equity -- let alone excellence -- if we don't also work to make our schools places where we all feel safe saying ""I don't know.""

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leah Hager Cohen.

71,"(CNN)Japan's Shimanami Kaido might be an expressway, but it was designed with the cyclist in mind.

A spectacular 60-kilometer road-and-bridge network connecting Japan's main island of Honshu with Shikoku (the nation's fourth largest island), it spans six smaller islands in the process and features bike and pedestrian lanes for its entire length.

The sublime scenery of the Shimanami Kaido (Island-Wave-Sea Route) runs from Onomichi in Hiroshima Prefecture down to Imabari in Ehime Prefecture.

Whichever way you travel, the views of the Seto Inland Sea National Park are sublime.

Cycling gives you the freedom to stop for a photo halfway across a bridge or detour to investigate lighthouses, shrines and natural wonders most automobile travelers zip past.

With 14 cycle rental terminals along the way, you can go at your own pace, spend a night at a campsite or inn or just hand your bike in at the nearest rental terminal and hop on a bus.

Some terminals even have electric bicycles for hire.

Experienced cyclists will be able to complete the entire route  -- there are a few challenging spots -- in a few hours.

Here's a look at some of the highlights.

Starting point: Onomichi

As of March, Onomichi is home to Japan's first hotel designed exclusively for cyclists: Hotel Cycle in the Onomichi U2 building, just five minutes' walk from the JR station.

Manager Katsunori Takahashi is huge cycling enthusiast, and it shows.

You can park your bike in your room, and there's even a cycle-through restaurant.

Taiwanese bike manufacturer Giant has a store in U2 catering to cyclists: bikes, accessories, repairs.

U2's Shima Shop sells local produce such as lemon comfiture and dried debera (five-spot flounder), an Onomichi delicacy.

As for Onomichi itself, the town was built on a hillside overlooking the sea, so the best way to see it before you head onto the Shimanami Kaido is to catch the ropeway to the top of Senkoji Hill and enjoy the panorama.

The walk down the Path of Literature is pleasant -- it winds past past boulders engraved with works by famous writers who've stayed in Onomichi over the centuries.

You'll see the splendid Senkoji Temple, which dates from 806 AD, one of the oldest temples in Japan.

A stamina boost comes in the form of Onomichi's legendary ramen.

Tsutafuji is one of the most popular ramen shops in town.

It's a mom and pop waterfront bar near the JR station that's been open more than 50 years.

There are just 10 stools inside, so you may have wait a while.

Once inside, you'll get a bowlful of noodles topped with pork in a pork-bone-and-fish broth.

'Orchard of Japan'

After a day in Onomichi, it's time to roll.

As soon as you've crossed Onomichi Strait and reached Mukaishima Island, you'll find yourself in a serene realm of citrus groves, set in the folds of forest-clad mountains.

Citrus is big business here.

The town of Setoda is Japan's number one producer of lemons, while Ehime Prefecture is known as the Orchard of Japan.

There are tangerines, oranges and hybrid fruits unique to these islands, such as anseikan (a cannonball-sized grapefruit).

Citrus-related products abound: cakes, jams, honey, sauces, juices.

World's longest suspension bridge

As you breeze across the routes magnificent bridges (seven of them), a labyrinth of misty islands unfolds below.

There are inhabited islands, desert islands and islands that are no more than a rock with a lone pine tree clinging to it.

A procession of trawlers, tugs and speedboats glides in and out the channels.

As for those bridges, their exquisite state of the art forms make them an attraction in their own right.

Tatara is one of the world's longest cable-stayed bridges -- its elegant 220-meter-high steel towers represent the folded wings of a crane.

At 4,045 meters long, Kurushima Bridge is the longest suspension bridge in the world.

Temples, fusion food, stunning sea

Deep in the heart of rural Japan, there's a rich amount of art and culture to enjoy.

Kosanji Temple on Ikuchijima Island is a must-visit.

Built in 1936 by Buddhist priest Koso Kosanji in memory of his mother, this wonderland of temples, pagodas and natural beauty took more than 30 years to complete.

Each building is modeled on famous temple buildings in Kyoto, Nikko and elsewhere, so visiting is like taking a stroll through Japanese history.

For the perfect ending to a trip (should you choose to loop back the way you came) you can't go wrong with the Bella Vista Hotel in the hills outside Onomichi.

The rooms are huge and offer views over the supreme serenity of the island-dotted sea.

There's exquisite fusion in the hotel's Italian restaurant (blowfish and tagliarini).

The hotel spa is open to the elements on one side, allowing fresh ocean breezes to cool your skin as you boil to a jelly while watching Jupiter rise over the Seto Sea.

Travel info

Shinkansen bullet trains depart Tokyo regularly for Shin-Onomichi station -- the trip takes about 4.5 hours. Domestic flights between Tokyo and Hiroshima take about an hour and 20 minutes.

Bicycles can be rented for 500 yen a day (children 300 yen). Tolls totaling 500 yen (about $5) are required for all bridge crossings.

By car, the tolls are about 4,000 yen one way.

A free shuttle bus to the Bella Vista Hotel runs from Onomichi JR station. The Tourist Office in the station can arrange it for you.

72,"(CNN) -- Sometimes it takes just one.

One person-- one idea -- to ignite a movement that changes lives.

Helping the millions of people who've fled the war in Syria may seem a challenge far too big for small relief efforts. The U.N. calls it the worst humanitarian crisis in a generation. The needs are staggering.

And yet, for some people, it's just not an option to do nothing.

I AM NOT A TOURIST

Tanya Khalil says she refuses to be a neutral observer. Her country, Lebanon, is taking in more Syrian refugees than any other -- nearly 1 million at last official count -- despite its tiny size.

The university student says it's impossible to walk the streets of Beirut without seeing reminders of the suffering -- some refugees searching for food, others sleeping on sidewalks.

""We cannot think somebody else will take care of it,"" Khalil says. ""We are that somebody. Each and every one of us is that somebody and it is our duty towards one another to be caring and compassionate souls.""

Khalil started a group called I AM NOT A TOURIST. The name was meant as a wake-up call to her fellow Lebanese -- that the Syrian crisis was now on their doorstep and they could no longer act like bystanders.

She couldn't stand the thought of Syrian refugees shivering in brutally cold temperatures while she and her friends were sleeping in their warm beds.

They began collecting winter clothing and blankets for refugees in Akkar and the Bekaa Valley in north Lebanon. Khalil estimates 4,500 people donated items, filling 25 huge trucks. ""We ended up with more than 10,200 'bags of love,' "" she says.

Unlike other host countries, Lebanon has no formal refugee camps. Refugees there are scattered across some 1,600 locations, complicating aid distribution. Khalil partnered with established NGOs to help with logistics: Sawa for Syria and War Child Holland.

The United Nations estimates nearly 2.5 million Syrians are seeking shelter in Lebanon and in other neighboring states, but that accounts for only registered refugees. The true number could be much higher. And the crisis is only getting worse, as thousands of Syrians flee across the border each day.

Sweaters for Syria

Ranya Alkadamani was half a world away when she felt compelled to help. It all started with a conversation with her brother.

An Australian citizen living in Perth, Alkadamani has Syrian parents and family in Beirut. Her brother was heading to Beirut and asked if she had any old sweaters that he could take for a U.N. relief effort.

She said sure -- and then realized she could do something even bigger.

She sent an e-mail to work colleagues, asking if they had any sweaters to contribute. The note touched her boss, who called her and said he wanted to help start a campaign and that he would pay for shipping the sweaters.

It became known as Sweaters for Syria.

Alkadamani says she was overwhelmed by the response. She was worried that they wouldn't receive enough donations to fill even one container, but ""in two weeks, we pretty much filled the Salvation Army's warehouse with 1,000 bags.""

The campaign inspired people across Perth. One 6-year-old boy is said to have collected 600 sweaters on his own. ""When people know there's something tangible that they can do to make a difference, they'll do it,"" Alkadamani says.

She cried when she saw all the bags piled up in the warehouse -- 100,000 sweaters in all. ""Everyone was so generous and they cared as much as I did, and they're not even Syrian,"" she says. ""That was overwhelming.""

The bags were delivered to the UNHCR for distribution in Turkey and Jordan. Alkadamani visited Jordan this month, helping to hand out sweaters to refugees who were crossing the border.

She also visited Zaatari, a sprawling camp in the desert now home to nearly 125,000 refugees. That effectively makes it one of the largest cities in Jordan, and one of the largest refugee camps in the world.

Life is harsh there, a far cry from the comforts of home refugees left in Syria. The war doesn't discriminate -- people from all walks of life have been forced to leave behind virtually everything they own. Alkadamani says she wants the world to understand that ""the people in those camps are just like you and me.""

Khalil also stresses that point. She says Syrian refugees are just normal people -- from doctors to pharmacists to teachers -- with normal lives before the war tore their world apart.

You can do something too

Major aid agencies like UNHCR are overwhelmed with the sheer scale of this crisis, so grassroots efforts can play an important role in filling the gaps. Aid organizations also encourage groups to raise cash donations, as they provide the flexibility to meet particular needs by trained relief workers.

In all of these ways, individual efforts can make a difference in the face of enormous suffering.

It starts with a simple idea -- and the willingness to act.

73,"(CNN) -- President Abraham Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd, needed a baby-sitter.

It was April 18, 1864, and the Lincolns had planned to go to a fair in Baltimore, returning the next day. They needed someone to watch their 11-year-old son, Tad.

A newly published letter from Mrs. Lincoln requesting a sitter gives rare insight into the family's life inside the Lincoln White House, showing one way the family had to juggle their busy schedules, just like everyone else.

The letter is being offered for sale by the Raab Collection, a dealer in historical documents, valued at $15,000.

It's not long -- just one line -- but the signed letter is in the first lady's hand.

""Hon. Mr. Harrington, We would like to have the services of Charles from today, at 2 P.M. until tomorrow at 11 A.M. Very Resp. Mrs. Lincoln.""

""Charles"" was Charles Forbes, a Treasury Department employee who was detailed to the Lincolns and often served as the president's valet, footman, messenger or attendant, according to the Raab Collection.

George Harrington was assistant secretary of the Treasury and Forbes' boss and handled personal financial matters for the Lincolns.

""Children in the White House have always held a great fascination with the American people,"" said Nathan Raab, vice president of the Raab Collection. ""It shows the president and first lady at their most personal, their most human.""

Mary Todd Lincoln ended up not going to the Baltimore event, likely too burdened with preparations for a reception the next night, the final White House reception of the season, Raab says.

Forbes' close family relationship soured a year later when President Lincoln was assassinated. Forbes was seated outside the president's box at Ford's Theatre and was the one who allowed the assassin, John Wilkes Booth, to enter. Forbes and the president's guard then left for a drink, leaving Lincoln unattended, Raab says.

Mary Todd Lincoln ended up blaming Forbes for her husband's death.

""Lincoln,"" a film about the 16th president and his battle to end slavery, is up for 12 Academy Awards this year, including best picture. The ceremony is scheduled to be broadcast Sunday night.

74,"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Haiti's economy is getting a boost thanks to a venture with one of Korea's largest companies that promises to bring 20,000 garment industry jobs to a new industrial park in the north of the country.

Former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive were joined by members of the Interim Haitian Recovery Commission, the Inter-American Development Bank, Haitian business leaders and the chairman of Sae-A Trading Co. Ltd. at the Haiti Apparel Center in Port-au-Prince as they signed an agreement to build the North Industrial Park. It's part of an effort to rebuild the Haitian economy that began even before the earthquake struck one year ago.

""This will inspire people all over Latin America, the Caribbean, the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia who have thought seriously about investing in Haiti and not come through,"" said Clinton. ""What we need is a commitment to be competitive in getting investment and putting people to work, and then we need to build the institutions that will allow the people to flower. That is our commitment.""

Smiling, Bellerive said that looking back over the past year, ""This is the best day of my life today.""

The project is expected to generate $500 million in wages and benefits over 10 years and result in Haiti's first textile mill, according to its backers. Investment in the industrial park will also include the construction of at least 5,000 homes. The United States will oversee the construction of a power grid that will provide electricity to the park and the surrounding area.

The garment industry had been the prime source of Haitian exports before the earthquake and it remains so today. About 28,000 people currently work in Haiti's garment sector, manufacturing products for Gap, JCPenney, Wal-Mart, New Balance and other well-known brands.

Georges Sassine owns a garment plant in Port-au-Prince that employs 530 people. He believes the garment industry holds the key to growing Haiti's economy and making the country self-sufficient.

""Today, this industry represents over 50% of our earned foreign currency earnings. It also represents over 50% of the total commercial exports of Haiti,"" he said.

Sassine didn't have a problem retaining buyers after the earthquake. ""We shipped our first container 10 days after the quake. We were ready to do business.""

At the time, he had to ship his goods over land to the Dominican Republic before delivering them to buyers. Today, he is able to ship goods from a reopened port in the capital, Port-au-Prince.

75,"(CNN) -- Crews in Southern California struggled to get the upper hand on a fast-moving wildfire in Santa Barbara County early Tuesday.

Known as the White Fire, the blaze had already charred some 1,000 acres after getting its start Monday afternoon, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Andrew Madsen said. The flames were 5% contained.

The Forest Service expects to have 700 personnel in place Tuesday morning.

The Santa Barbara Sheriff's Department evacuated up to 6,000 people from the popular White Rock Campground at the end of the busy Memorial Day weekend as the wildfire advanced, public information officer Kelly Hoover said.

Although the fire caused minor damage to a ranger station, it quickly moved deeper into Los Padres National Forest, away from homes and structures, according to Madsen.

No injuries or fatalities have been reported.

Santa Barbara is located about 85 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

76,"(CNN)In the gentle yet fiercely warm surrounds of the southern Ugandan countryside, Mwanja Banuli looks on as farmhands fill his truck with sugar cane.

Packing this rough, woody crop is heavy going and making sure every inch of space is utilized is key.

Transport costs money, after all, and this humble sugar farmer has lots of costs to consider.

""There are many challenges in this business,"" Banuli says. ""Rent for our land costs about $300 and then you need to pay people to clear the land.

""You have to hire a tractor for ploughing and tilling the land. When you add up all these expenses, it's a big investment.""

Searching for Sugarman

In Uganda, sugar is big business.

This particular batch is headed for Kakira Sugar Limited -- one of the country's oldest and largest factories.

Kakira was founded by Muljibai Madhvani, an immigrant from the Indian subcontinent in the late 1920s.

It's a company still going strong to this day.

""What you see in the background is the first mill that was installed in 1930 to crush only 150 tons of cane,"" explains Kenneth Barungi, assistant general manager of Kakira at the site of the company's nearby factory.

""(Kakira) started expanding every 10 years, every 20 years, modernizing, acquiring more land, introducing irrigation, expanding the crushing capacity. By (the 1970s) they were producing about 83,000 tons of sugar.""

""That was about 50% of all the sugar produced in Uganda. At that time they (Kakira) contributed to about 53% of the national GDP... just because of manufacturing and industry,"" he added.

Dawn of dictatorship

It was at this time, however, that history intervened in the shape of one of the 20th century's most brutal rulers.

After a military coup in 1971, army commander Idi Amin Dada seized power. The former heavyweight boxer made himself Uganda's president and a brutal dictatorship followed.

The often erratic Amin praised Hitler and said the German dictator ""was right to burn six million Jews."" He even bizarrely offered to be king of Scotland if asked.

Within a year he had expelled the country's Asian population, numbering around 35,000.

After almost 50 years, the Madhvanis were no longer welcome in Uganda.

Those who stayed, did so at their own risk.

""When Idi Amin told every Asian to leave, they all left the country and went mainly to the UK,"" Barungi continued, adding that he believes this when Uganda began to economically fall apart.

""All industries collapsed, all international trade collapsed. There was no longer available foreign exchange to import machinery. Even if you imported the machinery you didn't have technical expertise here to run such industries.""

""Within a few years Kakira Sugar Industries had collapsed, but so had infrastructure in Uganda. Social services, everything had collapsed.""

A new start

After Idi Amin was deposed in 1979, however, some of the ejected population slowly started coming back to Uganda.

Among the returnees were the Madhvanis. The country they left behind, however, was a very different place.

""The factory was a skeleton,"" Barungi said. ""There was no longer a sugar plantation, the houses were occupied by anybody. There was no business to run so it (the plantation) was just an empty shell.""

The Madhvanis quickly borrowed money from the World Bank and the African Development Bank and set about rebuilding their business.

It has grown rapidly over the last 25 years and now produces 18,000 tons of sugar (a year), Barungi said.

But the effects of the macabre, harrowing events of recent history still linger.

A sweeter deal?

Some reports suggest some black Ugandan workers resented how certain sections of the Indian mercantile class treated them.

These days, however, Kakira says it strives to promote a responsible philosophy for how it interacts with its workers.

Not only is this the right way to engage with people in its employ, they believe, it also improves productivity and staff mobility.

Kakira has built schools and hospitals to cater for their staff and their families while the company has also founded the Kakira Outgrowers Rural Development Fund (KORD), an NGO that provides the likes of workshops, loans and other services for its contractors.

Besides nearly 8,000 staff members, Kakira has almost as many contract workers in the shape of farmers, like Mwanja Banuli.

They farm the lands neighboring the plantations and are contracted to Kakira, supplying 70% of its sugarcane needs.

""To be able to sustain business you want agricultural farmers, plantation workers, you want factory workers and the vision of Muljibhai Mudhvani was to develop human resources,"" Barungi said.

This enlightened approach saw KORD awarded with a best NGO-business partnership award from the Ugandan Manufacturers Association.

But it's the positive impact on individual lives that offers the biggest reward for many in the community.

""Before KORD I was just useless,"" said Beatrice Katende, who has received assistance from the body's programs. ""I used to work as a casual laborer for other people in the community digging in their gardens to get some income.

""When KORD came into existence we learned to farm, to save and how to be self-sufficient.""

Through offering a hand up to people like Katende, Kakira hope to help themselves as well as provide assistance to other areas of the local economy.

""The main vision was to always make sure that there is labor supply always available to work at the factory. The excess can go and work in other industries in the country,"" Barungi said.

77,"(CNN)Emergency operators get lots of crazy calls, but few start like this.

Caller:  ""Hello, I'm trapped in this plane and I called my job, but I'm in this plane.""

Operator:  ""You're where?""

Caller:  ""I'm inside a plane and I feel like it's up moving in the air.  Flight 448 can you please tell somebody (to) stop it.""

The frantic 911 call came just as the Alaska Airlines flight had taken off from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon.  The caller was a ramp agent who fell asleep in the plane's cargo hold.

The cell phone call soon broke up, but the man was making himself known in other ways as the crew and passengers reported unusual banging from the belly of the Boeing 737.

The pilot radioed air traffic control and said he would make an emergency landing.

""There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around,"" he told air traffic control.

The ramp agent who took the untimely nap and caused all the fuss is an employee of Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage.

He'll no longer have the option of dozing aboard one of the airline's planes.

""The Menzies employee has been permanently banned from working on Alaska Airlines planes,"" said Bobbie Egan, a spokeswoman for the airline.

Flight 448, which was on its way to Los Angeles, only spent 14 minutes in the air. Other than being scared, the agent never was in any real danger.

The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said.

The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off.

""All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear,"" Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC.

Not everyone heard the banging, but it was soon clear this wasn't a normal flight.

""We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did,"" passenger Marty Collins told affiliate KOMO.

""When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane.""

""I think it's scary and really unsafe, too,"" Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. ""Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?""

The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. The agent was off the two days prior to the incident and had taken a lunch break and a break in the afternoon before making his way into the cargo hold, according to a source familiar with the investigation.

The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight.

""During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home,"" the airline's blog said.

It's believed he was hidden by luggage, making it difficult for the rest of his team to see him, the source said.

All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline.

After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles a couple of hours late.

78,"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Talks among regional African leaders failed Monday to resolve a long-standing power-sharing dispute between embattled Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.

South African former president Thabo Mbeki is shown at talks Monday in Harare.

After the meeting a visibly angry Mugabe said talks faltered after Tsvangirai, head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), presented proposals which differed from recommendations by the 15-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC).

""The talks did not go very well. ... MDC have a proposal which is in conflict with the SADC and we opposed it and then the talks broke down,"" Mugabe said. ""We will continue with discussions here at home. We shall continue to exchange ideas and see where the differences are with the SADC proposal.""

The meeting had drawn the leaders of Mozambique and South Africa, as well as former South African President Thabo Mbeki.

In light of the continued stalemate, SADC executive secretary Tomaz Salamao told journalists that South African leader Kgalema Motlanthe, who is leading the SADC, had called for a summit on January 26. The meeting will be held in Botswana or South Africa.

Tsvangirai blamed Mugabe for the failure of the talks.

""For us as the MDC this is probably the darkest day of our lives,"" Tsvangirai told reporters as he left the hotel where the 12-hour-long meeting took place. ""I am sure the whole nation is waiting anxiously for the resolution of this crisis. We are committed to this deal but subject to (ruling party) ZANU-PF conceding on these issues.""

Mugabe told the state media that Monday's meeting would be the final one, and that he would form a government without the opposition if no agreement was reached.

The MDC has not been able to settle with Mugabe since signing a power sharing deal in September. Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe of keeping the most powerful portfolios in the government for his party. The ministries under contention include home affairs, finance, foreign affairs, local government, information and defense.

Both Tsvangirai and Mugabe, along with Arthur Mutambara of a small faction of the MDC, are expected to attend next week's summit, Salamao said.

The power-sharing deal is expected to keep Zimbabwe's melting economy from a total collapse. Zimbabwe is experiencing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis, with the highest inflation in the world officially at 231 million percent as of July 2008.

Analysts say the inflation is thriving because of an acute shortage of all essentials ranging from fuel, electricity, cash and food. The United Nations estimates that about 5 million people in Zimbabwe need urgent food aid.

A cholera epidemic has claimed more than 2,200 lives since its outbreak in August. The ravaging cholera has been made worse by a four-months-long industrial action by doctors and nurses demanding higher pay.

79,"CRAWFORD, Texas (CNN) -- Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan doesn't come around President Bush's ranch any more, but there's a new kid in town trying to get his attention.

Peace activist Alix Bryan traveled 11,000 miles to President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.

Peace activist Alix Bryan, 33, arrived near the ranch here on Saturday afternoon aboard a motor scooter that goes about 55 miles per hour -- on 12-inch wheels.

She drove the scooter from the White House to a home in Crawford dubbed by anti-war activists as the ""Peace House,"" mapping out a circuitous route that formed a peace sign.

Sheehan used to frequent the house.

Bryan bears little resemblance to Sheehan, a California woman who gained national attention as a protest leader after her son Casey was killed fighting in Iraq.

Sheehan's loss prompted her to camp near Bush's home in Crawford throughout August 2005, demanding a meeting with the president to discuss her son. Bush refused to see her, and she abandoned her protests in Texas last year.

Bryan's odyssey took three months. She journeyed more than 11,000 miles braving elements ranging from rain to wind and even one speeding ticket (which she says she talked her way out of). ( Watch Bryan arrive in Crawford »)

""I had my moments actually where I was just exhausted, I mean it's draining,"" Bryan said upon her arrival in Crawford. ""I've ridden in heat from 105 degrees to temperatures (as low as) 40 degrees.""

Bryan blogged about the trip on the Web site of Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, the liberal presidential candidate, and sustained herself with donations to her own site, www.peacescooter.com.

Bryan said she always planned to end her trip in Crawford and hoped to arrive on September 15 after hitting the road from the White House in July. But weather delays and running out of gas once delayed her arrival in Texas until this weekend, when Bush happens to be spending time at his ranch.

While the odds of landing a meeting with the president are remote at best, Bryan said if she had the chance she would like to start a dialogue of peace based on the conversations she had with Americans along the way.

""I would say even those who voted for Bush do not support this war,"" she said.

But the large crowds of antiwar activists that followed Sheehan around Crawford in the summer of 2005 have long since vanished.

A ""rally"" at the Peace House to celebrate Bryan's arrival drew just a handful of antiwar activists. Nevertheless, Bryan said she was not defeated.

""Calm seas,"" she said, ""don't make good sailors."" E-mail to a friend

81,"Tokyo (CNN) -- Six Chinese maritime surveillance ships briefly entered waters around a group of islands at the center of a heated territorial dispute between Tokyo and Beijing, ignoring warnings from the Japanese authorities amid escalating tensions in the region.

The Chinese ships arrived near the uninhabited islands -- which Japan calls Senkaku and China calls Diaoyu -- on Friday morning and began patrols and ""law enforcement,"" China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported.

The islands, situated in the East China Sea between Okinawa and Taiwan, are currently under Japanese control, but China claims they have been an ""inherent"" part of its territory ""since ancient times."" The long-running argument over who has sovereignty has resulted in occasionally violent acts of public protest.

The United States,a key ally of Japan, has repeatedly urged Tokyo and Beijing to resolve the dispute through dialogue. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta will meet with his counterparts in Japan and China during a visit to the region that begins this weekend, the Department of Defense said Thursday.

The Chinese ships entered Japanese territorial waters Friday despite warnings from the Japanese Coast Guard, said Shinichi Gega, a spokesman for Japan's 11th Regional Coast Guard Headquarters.

The vessels had all left the waters by mid-afternoon and headed north, the Japanese Coast Guard said later Friday, noting that sea in the area was getting rough as a huge storm, Super Typhoon Sanba, approached from the south.

Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said Japan would intensify its own patrols of the area in response to what he described as an ""unprecedented scale of invasion"" of Japanese waters.

See a map of Asia's disputed islands

Tokyo has protested the ""inappropriate, illegal act"" to the Chinese authorities, Fujimura said.

Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said Japan would ""take all possible measures to ensure security"" around the islands.

Two of the Chinese ships responded to a Japanese Coast Guard vessel's warning by reiterating China's territorial claim to the islands and saying they were carrying out patrol work, according to Gega. Japanese ships and helicopters are continuing their own patrols of the area, he said.

The controversial Chinese move to begin patrols around the islands follows the Japanese government's purchase of several of the islands from a private Japanese owner earlier this week, a deal that China described as ""illegal and invalid.""

Read about China's warning of economic fallout

The purpose of the patrols is ""to demonstrate China's jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands and its affiliated islets and ensure the country's maritime interests,"" Xinhua reported Friday, citing a government statement.

This week, China announced what it said were the boundaries of its territorial waters around the islands to back up its claim of sovereignty. It said it had filed a copy of the announcement with U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday to comply with international law.

But Fujimura insisted Friday that the islands are an ""integral part of Japanese territory"" under international law, highlighting how directly opposed the two sides are.

Animosity between the two countries over the islands runs deep.

They have come to represent what many Chinese people see as unfinished business: redressing the impact of the Japanese occupation of large swathes of eastern China during the 1930s and 1940s.

China says its claim goes back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895.

Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further.

The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa.

Tokyo's diplomatic corps suffered an unexpected setback Thursday when the newly appointed Japanese ambassador to China, Shinichi Nishimiya, collapsed in Tokyo and was hospitalized just two days after he was named to the post.

CNN's Junko Ogura reported from Tokyo and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong.

82,"East Rutherford, New Jersey (CNN) -- From nuclear weapons to human rights, the image of Iran is quite negative in America. But with little fanfare, one Iranian man has won hearts and cheers battling Americans on the court in basketball arenas around the country.

Hamed Haddadi is the NBA's first Iranian basketball player. At 7-foot-2, Haddadi began playing for Tennessee's Memphis Grizzlies in August 2008. His final game of this season was set for Wednesday night in Oklahoma City.

Despite U.S.-Iran tensions in the political arena, any strains appear absent with teammates and fans alike.

""It seems like he's the most popular Grizzly. When we go on the road ... he has a lot of support from a lot of people, a lot of people come out to watch him and watch us play,"" said teammate Mike Conley, who accompanied Haddadi to a ""kebab fest.""

The kebab fest was held in Las Vegas in 2009. Haddadi was accompanied by Conley and fellow Grizzly Hakim Warrick to a Persian restaurant. The event served to introduce the teammates to Persian food. Grizzlies' forward Rudy Gay turned the tables when he took Haddadi for a taste of American ribs at a Memphis restaurant.

It wasn't as easy getting permission to play in the United States. Current U.S. sanctions on Iran prohibit ""a person or organization in the United States from engaging in business dealings with Iranian nationals,"" stated the NBA legal counsel.

The NBA had to apply to the U.S. government for a license that granted Haddadi permission to play for the NBA.

The reception has been positive courtside. But problems arose from game announcers once.

Ralph Lawler and Mike Smith, L.A. Clippers announcers on local Fox Sports, were suspended for a game for insensitive comments about Haddadi. When the Grizzlies faced the Clippers, the two joked about the Iranian center.

""You're sure it's not Borat's older brother?"" said Smith. ""If they ever make a movie about Haddadi, I'm going to get Sacha Baron Cohen to play the part.""

Mayar Zokaei, Haddadi's Iranian-American manager, said the Iranian basketball player has brought lots of media attention to the middle-of-the-standings Grizzlies.

""He's gotten more press then any of his teammates this year and the past couple of years just for the sole reason that he's Iranian-American,"" said Zokaei. ""Iranian playing basketball in America ... that's rare. [There aren't many]) Iranians doing anything in bona fide sports arenas in the U.S.""

Haddadi faces big challenges. One is speaking and learning English.

Furthermore, his family is almost 7,000 miles away in Iran. The political turmoil back home is something he can't control. He worries about his family.

""It affects him because he misses them, he's not able to keep up to date with them because he's so busy ... he's always concerned about their well-being and such,"" said Zokaei.

Off the court, Haddadi has been working to bridge the gap between Iranian-Americans and basketball. Haddadi was at the forefront of creating the Hamed Haddadi Javanan Foundation. The charity organization aims to award college scholarships to student athletes.

The foundation has not been his only initiative.

In 2009, with Los Angeles Lakers forward Ron Artest and manager Zokaei, Haddadi hosted a weekend basketball camp for 100 children.

The camp was held on the campus of California State University at Northridge and was aimed mainly at the Iranian-American community.

Haddadi's team did not make the NBA playoffs, which start within the week. His next test on the court -- playing for Iran against the United States in the world championships in September in Turkey. Haddadi and teammate Rudy Gay agree the United States will win.

""Tell you the truth ... we can't beat the United States you know,"" said Haddadi. ""We're [The U.S.] gonna win, of course,"" boasted Gay.

But his two years in America have been a personal victory for Haddadi, who just wants to play more when he returns to America.

83,"(CNN) -- Starting Monday, students at the University of California Santa Barbara will be getting an unapproved vaccine scientists hope will stop a meningococcal disease outbreak there, the university said.

The Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis already has approval for its vaccine Bexsero in Europe, Canada and Australia. It is not approved for use in the United States.

In this case, the Food and Drug Administration had to grant special permission for its use at UCSB. The FDA granted special permission to use the vaccine at Princeton last December to fight an unrelated outbreak there.

Meningitis B outbreaks are rare but deadly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2012, there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis; some 160 of those were group B, the agency said.

There were eight confirmed cases at Princeton and four UCSB students were confirmed as sick with meningococcal disease, which can cause meningitis or blood infections.

One case at UCSB was so advanced, doctors had to remove a student's lower legs in November. Aaron Loy had been a promising lacrosse and soccer player. After his operation his parents asked the FDA to pick up the pace on Bexsero's approval.

""We hope that Aaron's horrific illness brings increased awareness and rapid approval by the FDA of the vaccine"" for the type B strain, Mike Loy said.

There are vaccines approved in the United States for other types of meningitis, but group B is the strain that does ""pack the most powerful punch,"" the CDC said.

College students are especially vulnerable. Students who drink a lot of alcohol can be particularly susceptible to catching it. Dorms are the perfect breeding grounds for an outbreak.

Meningitis B spreads through coughing, sneezing, and kissing. It can also spread when people forget to wash their hands or clothes, or among people who drink out of the same cup.

Meningitis B is tricky since students who catch it may first think they have the flu. It starts with flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, stiff necks, vomiting and delirium. If the bacteria spread to the protective tissue around the spinal cord and brain, known as the meninges, patients can suffer hearing loss, permanent neurological damage and even death.

The CDC sent a team of scientists to UCSB to study the outbreak in December. Fortunately, scientists said, a meningitis B outbreak moves slowly than others.

""It smolders,"" said Dr. Tom Clark, the chief of the CDC's meningitis branch. ""You have a bit more time to get everything in place.""

Bexsero will be offered to some 20,000 students at UCSB. More than 5,000 were vaccinated at Princeton University and they are currently getting a second dose which is necessary for full immunity.

Novartis says it is seeking U.S. license for the vaccine's use in all adolescents and young adults which they say would ""enable immediate response to future outbreaks,"" according to its press release.

""These recent outbreaks remind us how unpredictable the disease can be,"" said Andrin Oswald, division head for Novartis Vaccines. His company has submitted successful test results from 8,000 vaccinations of adults, children, adolescents and infants.

That test data was used for vaccine approval in other countries. ""We will continue to work with the FDA to pursue a potential license for Bexsero in the U.S. to help fulfill this public health need,"" Oswald said.

84,"(CNN) -- A spokesman for a national registry of radiologic technologists declined Friday to say whether the group was aware of a 2010 incident in which David Kwiatkowski allegedly tested positive for illegal drugs and was fired from an Arizona hospital.

After being fired from the Phoenix hospital, Kwiatkowski went on to work at four more hospitals in four other states.

He was arrested this month in New Hampshire in connection with stealing drugs from a hospital, and it's believed he infected 30 people in that state with hepatitis C through infected syringes.

Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire said it consulted the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists before hiring Kwiatkowski and he held the required certification for his cardiovascular tech position.

The registry's website says Kwiatkowski's certification was ""summarily suspended"" as of July 2012.

Kwiatkowski was working at Arizona Heart Hospital in 2010 when a fellow employee found him passed out in the men's bathroom, according to documents obtained by CNN.

Hepatitis C outbreak in New Hampshire strikes fear in 7 other states

""I looked in the toilet and spotted a 5 cc syringe and a needle floating in the water,"" the employee said in a statement submitted to the Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency. ""The label was a blue fentanyl label... He then said 'Shit ... I am going to jail.'""

Fentanyl is a powerful narcotic frequently used in hospitals. Kwiatkowski flushed the syringe and needle down the toilet, according to the employee.

Kwiatkowski was immediately fired from Arizona Heart Hospital, according to a hospital spokeswoman. He then relinquished his license as a radiologic technologist.

""I don't have the resources nor money to fight the accusations,"" Kwiatkowski wrote at the time.

A few weeks later, he was working at Temple University Hospital in Pennsylvania, and then went on to work in Kansas and Georgia before working in New Hampshire.

The agency that placed Kwiatkowski in the Arizona job reported the incident to the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists, according to a spokeswoman for the agency, Springboard, Inc.

A spokesman for the national registry said they're investigating the allegations against Kwiatkowski. ""Because we have strict confidentiality policies, the status of an ongoing investigation is not released,"" the registry said in a statement.

Christopher Cook, a spokesman for the registry, declined to comment further.

The director of the Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency said officials stopped their investigation when Kwiatkowski moved out of state.

""We had no jurisdiction,"" said Aubrey Godwin. ""If drugs or alcohol were involved, we would want to get blood tests done, but he was out of state, so it was sort of hard to implement.""

An expert in so-called ""drug diversion"" said it's not uncommon for healthcare professionals to leave a state when they're being investigated for drug use.

""They just move on to the next job,"" said John Burke, president of the National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators. ""This is a much bigger problem than most people realize.""

Godwin, the director of the Arizona licensing board, said he's not sure if his group reported the 2010 incident to the national registry.

""It's not clear. I can't say. It would have been just a phone call, and I don't remember a phone call, but I'm not sure on that one,"" he told CNN.

In the Exeter case, Kwiatkowski has been charged with obtaining controlled substances by fraud and tampering with a consumer product, namely a hospital syringe, according to an affidavit filed in federal court. He is suspected of stealing fentanyl, the affidavit said.

Hepatitis C is considered to be among the most serious of hepatitis viruses. It is typically asymptomatic, going undetected until liver damage shows up, according to the Mayo Clinic.

New Hampshire's health department is asking everyone who was a patient in Exeter's operating rooms and the intensive care unit between April 1, 2011, and May 25 of this year be tested.

Those are two areas that Kwiatkowski visited during his ""routine duties to transport patients,"" an Exeter Hospital statement said. But it added he ""was not involved with procedures or patient care.""

Exeter, in a statement, said it conducted a background check and took other steps before hiring Kwiatkowski full time.

U.S. Attorney John P. Kacavas said his office interviewed employees at Exeter who said they had seen Kwiatkowski acting strangely, one time sweating profusely and with bloodshot eyes.

""One of them described him as unfit to provide medical care and his supervisor sent him home,"" Kacavas said. ""He provided a plausible explanation for his condition, which was that he had been crying his eyes out because his aunt had died and he was an emotional wreck.""

According to state, county and hospital officials, he worked as a radiology technician and medical technician in cardiac catheterization labs in the following locations:

85,"(CNN) -- Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick, who served 18 months in federal prison for bankrolling a deadly dogfighting ring, now has a dog.

""I understand the strong emotions by some people about our family's decision to care for a pet,"" he said in a statement released Thursday. ""As a father, it is important to make sure my children develop a healthy relationship with animals.""

He added that ""our pet is well cared for and loved as a member of our family.""

Michael Vick helps park get a second chance

""This is an opportunity to break the cycle,"" Vick said. ""To that end, I will continue to honor my commitment to animal welfare and be an instrument of positive change.""

In 2010, Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback shouldn't get a pet immediately and should have to meet certain benchmarks whenever he did.

But Pacelle, whose group has worked with Vick in public outreach efforts, said it would be wrong to close the door to his ever having a dog again.

""He's been going through counseling, he's been speaking to kids twice a month, and he needs to interact with animals,"" Pacelle said at the time. ""If he continues to hit these markers, then if his daughter wants a dog two or three years down the line ... I'm saying that we should be open to that possibility.""

Under the terms of his conviction, Vick had been barred from owning an animal.

The NFL suspended Vick in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of paying for a dogfighting operation in Virginia. He returned to the NFL in 2009.

86,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A man in an Afghan military uniform killed three U.S. troops Friday in southern Afghanistan, the latest in a series of assaults against NATO soldiers by Afghans clad in security force garb.

The man opened fire on the troops in the volatile Helmand province, said Maj. Lori Hodge, a spokeswoman for the International Assistance Security Force. Hodge did not immediately provide details about the attack, one of a handful in recent weeks to target NATO troops.

A Defense Department official said the three troops killed were part of a Special Operations Forces mission to stabilize a village in the Sarwan Qala area. They were meeting with local officials. NATO and Afghan troops have been searching for the gunman.

""It is too early to say that this latest incident is part of a stepped-up effort on the insurgents' part,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""We know they are trying to maximize media exposure of these events but our military believes that the operational impact has been negligible. Nonetheless these incidents do concern us and our hearts go out to all the victims and their families.""

In the strikes, known as ""green-on-blue"" attacks, Afghan security forces or militants dressed as local police or soldiers target coalition troops.

The problem has sapped troop morale, and coalition forces have been working to address it.

Earlier this year, Gen. John Allen, commander of the NATO-led force, said the systems that Afghans and coalition forces had put in place to help prevent these attacks were having an effect.

Allen said coalition officials were working on a new procedure to check the backgrounds of Afghans who sign up for the army or police force, and the Afghans ""have taken a lot of steps themselves.""

Bill Roggio, a terrorism analyst, said Afghan security personnel have killed an estimated 93 ISAF soldiers since May 2007, and they have killed 31 this year alone across the country.

These attacks have taken place in all areas in Afghanistan, not just in the south and east, said Roggio, managing editor of the Long War Journal blog, which reports and analyzes terror issues.

Two other green-on-blue incidents occurred this week, Roggio said. One was the killing of a U.S. soldier Tuesday by two Afghans wearing army uniforms. On Thursday, U.S. troops killed an Afghan soldier who tried to gun them down at a training center in Laghman province.

""The attack types are about split: About half seem to be Taliban infiltrators, or ANSF members who were turned by the Taliban,"" said Roggio. ANSF stands for Afghan National Security Forces.

Remembering the Chinook crash, a year later

""The other half seem to be disgruntled security personnel who have turned on troops for some sort of grievance. It is very difficult to know exactly what is happening given that ISAF does not release a lot of information on these attacks.""

Afghan intelligence agents have started going undercover during recruit training to spot signs of extremist tendencies among the newcomers, military officials say.

""The U.S. military has become so concerned with the green-on-blue attacks that it has ordered units to designate 'guardian angels' in each unit whose job is to provide security for troops working with Afghans. But the attacks have not abated,"" Roggio said.

Elsewhere in Helmand, a vehicle struck a roadside mine Friday, killing six civilians and wounding five others, President Hamid Karzai's office said. Women and children were among the casualties in the bombing, which Karzai condemned.

The British Defense Ministry announced Friday that one of its soldiers was killed in ""enemy action"" while on patrol in the Nad Ali district of Helmand on Thursday.

High-profile insurgent attacks against NATO and Afghan targets persist as the United States reduces its troop strength ahead of an anticipated 2014 handover of responsibility to Afghan forces.

In a separate incident, a strike Wednesday in Kunar province left five people dead -- USAID Foreign Service Officer Ragaei Abdelfattah, three ISAF service members and an Afghan civilian -- and injured a State Department Foreign Service officer.

The Department of Defense said that the three American troops died ""of wounds suffered when they encountered an insurgent who detonated a suicide vest."" Violence has raged during the Afghan war in Kunar province, on the border with Pakistan.

""On behalf of President Obama and the American people, I have sent my deepest condolences to Ragaei's family and to the entire U.S. Mission in Afghanistan,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a written statement released late Thursday.

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying two bombers targeted the American soldier near the entrance of the compound of the province council in Asadabad, according to a statement released by spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid.

Mujahid said the attack occurred as the troops were exiting a military vehicle and gathering to enter the compound. The Taliban claimed to have killed 17 soldiers, though the group is known to routinely claim responsibility for attacks and inflate casualty numbers.

The Defense Department identified the slain soldiers:

-- Army Command Sgt. Maj. Kevin J. Griffin, the senior enlisted soldier of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division from Fort Carson, Colorado.

-- Army Maj. Thomas E. Kennedy, 35, of West Point, New York.

-- Air Force Maj. Walter D. Gray, 38, of Conyers, Georgia.

Kennedy served on the brigade staff, while Gray was a flight commander attached as a liaison to the brigade, according to their respective service records.

Griffin, 45, of Laramie, Wyoming, was the brigade's senior ranking non-commissioned officer, the Defense Department said. He joined the Army in 1988 and participated in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to his service records.

Griffin deployed twice more to Iraq, once in 2007 and again in 2009. He deployed to Afghanistan in March with a headquarters company of the brigade.

Kennedy was commissioned as an officer in 2000. He served two tours in Iraq in 2003 and 2005. According to his service record, Kennedy deployed to Afghanistan on July 18.

Gray was assigned to the 13th Air Support Operations Squadron at Fort Carson.

An Afghan interpreter was also killed, the State Department said.

Troops were also wounded in the attack, said Maj. Martyn Crighton, a NATO spokesman. He would not release the number of injured but said ""all the seriously wounded were evacuated to Germany.""

87,"PARIS, France -- World number three Novak Djokovic crashed out of the Paris Masters after being trounced in his opening match by veteran Frenchman Fabrice Santoro on Wednesday.

Fabrice Santoro returns the ball during his shock second-round victory against Novak Djokovic.

The 34-year-old Santoro, who beat world No. 5 Andy Roddick at the Lyon Grand Prix last week, again rose to the occasion in front of his home fans as he stormed to a 6-3 6-2 second-round victory against the Serb.

It was the first time the two players had met, with Djokovic making his first outing since losing to David Nalbandian in the semifinals of the Madrid Masters two weeks ago.

Djokovic, like the American Roddick, has already qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup and will now have extra time to prepare for the event in Shanghai starting next month.

The 20-year-old said he was struggling following dental surgery to remove two wisdom teeth.

""I couldn't give my 100 percent, not even 30 percent of my possibilities,"" Djokobvic said.

""He deserved to win. I'm still on medications. I didn't practise for a whole week, I only started practising two days ago. Physically, I'm not feeling at all good.""

The result is a boost for rising British star Andy Murray, who earlier kept alive his hopes of an unexpected place at the Masters Cup by winning his first match in Paris and was expected to face Djokovic.

The 20-year-old, who has missed three months this season due to a wrist injury, beat Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to progress into the third round.

The 15th seed is seeking to overtake Tommy Haas, who holds the eighth and final place ahead of the showpiece event in Shanghai.

Murray, who trails the German by just three points, has not beaten Djokovic in three meetings so far but he has never played his unseeded next opponent Santoro.

Ninth seed Haas, who has struggled with illness and injury this year, will play Djokovic's compatriot Janko Tipsarevic in the second round.

Murray, who won his second title this year at the St Petersburg Open last Sunday, made a confident start against Nieminen and showed little sign of the stiff back he suffered after a minor car crash on Monday.

He held his serve to love against a player who was beaten in the final of the Swiss Indoors event by Roger Federer last weekend, but then struggled for his best form as the first set went to a tiebreak.

The Scot was broken just one point after having a winner overturned following an on-court appeal, but he leveled immediately and then broke Nieminen again to win a third successive game before serving out for victory.

Defending champin and fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, one of six players to have already qualified for Shanghai, beat Argentina's Juan Del Potro 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 in his opening match on Wednesday.

The Russian, fined for ""lack of effort"" after his defeat by Croatian qualifier Marian Cilic in St Petersburg, will next face Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in round three after Baghdatis shocked 13th seed Ivan Ljubicic.

Ivo Karlovic broke Roger Federer's serve for the first time in his life, but the top seed and world number one progressed in a late match on Wednesday.

Croatian Karlovic, the tallest man in tennis at 2.08 metres, went down 6-4 4-6 6-3 as Federer played for the first time at the Bercy event since 2003.

Federer had gone 67 service games over four previous matches without a loss before Karlovic ended his duck to claim their second set.

But the Swiss top seed got straight back in harness, breaking to start the final set and rolling ahead against a man he had just beaten days earlier in the Basel semifinals.

World numbet two Rafael Nadal also reached the third round after thrashing Italy's Filippo Volandri 6-3 6-1.

The Spaniard will next play Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, who won by the same scoreline against 16th seed Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina. E-mail to a friend

88,"(CNN)  -- Hulk Hogan said his comments to Rolling Stone magazine that he can ""totally understand"" O.J. Simpson -- the former football great found liable for the deaths of his wife and another man -- are being misunderstood.

Linda and Hulk Hogan enjoy happier times at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards in New York.

The pro wrestling legend said Wednesday that he ""took the high road"" and ""didn't do the O.J. Simpson thing"" despite the pain of his bitter divorce fight with wife Linda.

Hogan's lawyer said the quotes leaked to a gossip column have been taken out of context and the full article proves Hogan ""never condones the O.J. situation.""  Watch Hogan claim he was misquoted »

A spokesman for Linda Hogan said the statement amounts to a death threat and that her attorney is ""weighing all options necessary to protect his client.""

""His violent and scary mood swings have been my nightmare for too many years,"" Linda Hogan said Thursday in a written statement. ""I hope for the sake of our kids that he gets the psychological help for himself and the safety of others.""

Her spokesman, Gary Smith, said, ""For those who buy his claim the comment was taken out of context, read the rest of Rolling Stone and determine for yourself if his suicidal tendencies coupled with the use of drugs and alcohol make him a danger.""

The controversial quote is part of a eight-page feature article about Hogan to be published in the magazine's Friday edition.

""I could have turned everything into a crime scene like O.J., cutting everybody's throat,"" Hogan told Rolling Stone. ""You live half a mile from the 20,000-square-foot home you can't go to anymore, you're driving through downtown Clearwater [Florida] and see a 19-year-old boy driving your Escalade, and you know that a 19-year-old boy is sleeping in your bed, with your wife... .

""I totally understand O.J. I get it.""

The controversy began with a leak of the quote to the New York Post's Page 6 gossip column.

Hogan lawyer David Houston said that quote was ""part of a larger conversation to exemplify degrees of emotional turmoil.""

""Earlier reports to the contrary exemplify the danger of cherry-picking quotes and reacting to them,"" Houston said.

Hogan spoke later Wednesday to a photographer with the gossip Web site TMZ:

""I spent three days with a writer for Rolling Stone talking about being positive and happy and walking in the spirit of Christ. And he asked me, 'Well, why didn't you flip out?' Well, I didn't jump off the Empire State building, I didn't buy a white Bronco. I didn't do the O.J. Simpson thing. I took the high road.

""I'm not focused on Linda anymore,"" Hogan said.

It has been widely reported that Linda Hogan, 49, is dating a younger man. She filed for divorce in 2007 after nearly 25 years of marriage.

Simpson was found not guilty of murder in the 1994 stabbing deaths of his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, but was found liable for their deaths by a civil court jury.

Simpson later was found guilty in a Las Vegas, Nevada, armed robbery case and sentenced in December to up to 33 years in prison.

Linda Hogan's spokesman linked the comments to the 55-year-old Hogan's three-decade career, during which he held multiple championship titles and, during his heyday in the 1980s, was easily the most popular wrestler in the world.

""We have always maintained that the fear that Linda has had to live with comes from the rage and instability much too often associated with pro wrestlers,"" Smith said in the statement.

Hulk Hogan's real name is Terry Bollea. His wife alternately goes by Linda Hogan and Linda Bollea.

CNN's Marc Balinsky contributed to this report.

89,"Washington (CNN) -- Some very preliminary talks have been under way ""for the past few days"" to potentially allow Boston bomb suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to resume providing investigators with information about the attacks in exchange for having the death penalty taken off the table, two government sources say.

The sources said such initial communications between opposing sides on a range of procedural and other issues are standard procedure.

Communications are in the very early stages, and not a sign lawyers for either side are ready to make a deal, said one source, who did not want to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the private discussions. The source emphasized these are not formal negotiations, and no deals have been offered.

The discussions between prosecution and defense attorneys are at a ""preliminary, delicate stage"" and both refused to offer details of what either side would be willing to leverage, according to the sources. A Justice Department official said it is not accurate to suggest there are negotiations.

""The notion that we are engaging in discussions over a penalty is not accurate,"" the official said. ""As far as I know, there are no negotiations.""

The government has not said whether it will seek the death penalty in this case.

Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd noted Tuesday that ""the federal charges against Tsarnaev authorize a penalty, upon conviction, of death or imprisonment for life, or any term of years."" The charges include using a weapon of mass destruction.

From fear to cheers: The final hours that paralyzed Boston

""We have no comment at this time on what potential penalty the government might seek if the defendant is convicted, particularly given that the defendant has only just been charged,"" Boyd added.

This comes after a federal magistrate judge Monday approved appointment of a defense attorney who specializes in handling capital cases. Judy Clarke of San Diego has a reputation of working with high-profile clients to get death-eligible crimes reduced.

She has represented Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, Atlanta Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph, and most recently Tucson mass shooter Jared Lee Loughner. Clarke separately cut deals for all three to avoid lethal injection.

The suspect is hospitalized with gunshot wounds at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical center in Devens, Massachusetts.

He and his brother, Tamerlan, are suspected of detonating two explosive devices at the Boston Marathon race April 15, leaving three dead and more than 175 people wounded. The elder Tsarnaev was killed three days later in a gun battle with police.

Legal sources say it is not unusual for both sides to reach out and begin these kinds of conversations in high-profile criminal cases. Those sources say both Tsarnaev's legal team and top-level Justice Department officials also have been meeting separately to weigh their options.

Two federal public defenders in Boston -- William Fick and Miriam Conrad -- were in the hospital room April 22 when Tsarnaev had his first court appearance, and had his Miranda rights first read to him by federal Magistrate Marianne Bowler. Those lawyers had asked for Clarke to join the legal team, and they must decide whether their client will cooperate with the ongoing investigation.

Tsarnaev's lawyers must weigh the initial evidence the government has presented against their client, and the strength of any additional charges that may be added when a formal indictment is presented in coming weeks. That evidence and Tsarnaev's own private statements about his alleged involvement will shape whether plea negotiations develop over time.

On the other side, government sources say investigators are eager to resume questioning of Tsarnaev, for any details about other possible suspects and plots. What may have motivated the brothers to allegedly commit the terror acts is also of major interest to the U.S. intelligence community.

Removing execution as a legal option could induce the suspect to talk, but nothing is expected until a grand jury hands down an indictment. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder would have the final say on whether prosecutors would pursue the death penalty at trial. That decision, too, is some weeks off, said another government source.

A special team of federal agents were able to speak with the seriously wounded Tsarnaev for about two days without any Miranda warnings being given, under a ""public safety exception."" CNN has learned the young man admitted to the acts, and said he and his brother acted alone. Sources say he has since stopped talking with the government.

CNN's Joe Johns and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.

90,"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- For many U.S. veterans it's a trip they thought they'd never take; returning to South Korea, the land where so many of their brothers-in-arms lost their lives.

A mist hangs in the surrounding hills of the South Korean National Cemetery as dozens of returning veterans gather to honor the dead.

It's a difficult but necessary journey for most of them as they commemorate the 60th anniversary of the armistice that stopped the fighting in the Korea War.

""I was in the Pork Chop Hill in July 1953 and I remember the sounds of artillery and fighting. That is not something that you will forget. I never intended to come back to Korea. It's not like I didn't like the country but just didn't need to see it,"" says U.S. veteran Danny Peters.

Almost two million Korean civilians lost their lives during the war as well as more than 200,000 South Koreans and about 36,000 American soldiers by the time the ceasefire was declared in 1953.

A lone bugler plays taps as men in their 80s, many dressed in military regalia complete with medals and ribbons, march towards an altar of incense and flowers to honor the dead. Some veterans now need canes and wheelchairs to help them complete the 40-meter stretch.

Sixty years on, they aren't the strapping teenagers they once were, the years show in the wrinkles crisscrossing their faces but the memories are still fresh.

""The Korean War was very dangerous and I lost a lot of friends,"" says veteran Daniel Arthur. ""I remember all the battles I was in. I lost a lot of friends and saw a lot of people wounded.""

For infantryman Philip DiMenno it's a journey he wanted to share with his two daughters, son and granddaughter. For him, it was about closing a chapter in his life, but for his children it was a chance to understand what the war was like.

It's DiMenno's first time back since he left the peninsula in 1954. Long gone are the dirt roads and huts. Asphalt and high-rises have taken their place. But the memories of a young, scared 18-year-old rush back among the tombstones.

""I wanted to do the real thing. When I'm saying do the real thing that was just a figure of talk at that time, because in all fairness I was a very, very scared kid and I had a lot of fear in me,"" says DiMenno.

The lively 81-year-old widower's memory doesn't fail as he recalls in descriptive detail to his family the two years he spent in South Korea.

""To be with him here now... I can see a huge difference in his emotions and how trying to gather everything that happened it's unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable,"" says DiMenno's granddaughter, Sara Zepezauer.

His daughter, Renee DiMenno-Zepezauer, added: ""The great connection and almost a closure for my father to see a country in such despair and to see a country again with such prosperity.""

The thought of the war has brought up mixed emotions from the veterans. Some of them express anger, sorrow and fear but most come to the same general conclusion.

Read more: Talking peace with a backdrop of war

""It (the Korean War) was pain in the ass. It disrupted a lot of lives of the Americans and lives of the Koreans. At the time, you always wondered if it was worth it. To think about it now, it accomplished a lot to the region and the world's order.""

""Don't tell the veterans that the war was nonsense,"" says DiMenno with a sense of defiance and pride. ""It stopped the spread of communism in Asia.""

The ceremony honoring the dead doesn't last long, less than a half hour. The veterans salute the memorial, pour incense into a smoldering pot flanked by two giant statues and say their silent prayers. But for DiMenno it can't last long enough.

""We were never told to cry and it makes you cry because we are the survivors. We are just a little patch of what we did. Sure we survived for our country. The people who died should have these honors.""

91,"(EW.com) -- Two Four characters on NBC's ""Smash"" are expected to leave the show -- and we suspect fans are not going to be disappointed.

Philandering fiancÃ© Dev (Raza Jaffrey) and devious assistant Ellis (Jaime Cepero) will not be regulars in the show's second season, sources say. It's possible one or both actors could appear in an episode or two to wrap up their storylines, but that's it. The plan is to have neither character as a recurring presence in the show's new-and-improved second season.

Dev annoyed fans by cheating on Karen (Katharine McPhee) while Ellis infuriated viewers all season with his overeager meddlesome scheming. Fans and critics have been pretty outspoken that the second season would be better off without either character (Ellis, in particular) and it seems producers and/or NBC listened.

NBC plans to return ""Smash"" in midseason, giving time for new showrunner Josh Safran (""Gossip Girl"") to creatively polish the series. NBC had no comment.

UPDATE: Brian d'Arcy James, who played Julia's (Debra Messing) husband Frank, and Will Chase, who played Julia's former lover Michael, are leaving ""Smash,"" too. In the finale, Frank saw Julia comforting Michael on stage and assumed the duo were back to their old, ahem, tricks.

92,"(CNN) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung urged authorities Wednesday to ""urgently implement"" relief efforts after Typhoon Ketsana slammed into the country hours earlier.

A man walks by a lake alongside the national north-south highway near Danang, Vietnam, on Tuesday.

The prime minister said in a written statement that he sent his ""profound condolences to the families of killed and wounded,"" and to those who suffered damage to their homes and property.

The government did not say how many people had been killed or were reported missing. Numerous news agencies reported the deaths of more than a dozen people. CNN could not independently verify the reports.

The prime minister said resources in several provinces would be focused on searching for missing people; treating the wounded; moving those in flooded areas; and providing people with food and water.

After it struck central Vietnam, Ketsana weakened to a tropical storm, forecasters said.

""The system is expected to completely dissipate over land within the next 12 hours as it continues to track to the west,"" the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said in its final statement issued on the storm at 11 a.m. Tuesday ET.  Watch a report on the storm from Vietnam »

Aid agencies reported that amid flood warnings, about 200,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas to community centers and schools on higher ground.

""Today was pretty bad, they say that this is the worst of it,"" iReporter Jeff Puchalski, 43, told CNN, speaking from Danang. ""It was very strong winds,"" he said.  Watch video from Puchalski »

Puchalski, who lives in Ho Chi Minh City, was staying at a resort in Danang. His video from outside the resort showed tiles falling from the roof and littering the ground. Although he had intended to stay only for a weekend, he said he was stuck there until the storm passed.

""We're also getting very heavy rains,"" he said.

Ketsana's maximum winds were reported at 167 km/h (104 mph) with gusts as strong as 204 km/h (127 mph) as it crossed over the South China Sea and approached land.

The city of Hue, Vietnam, picked up an estimated 13 inches of rainfall in a day, according to CNN Meteorologist Jennifer Delgado. Are you there? Share your story or pictures

The global relief agency World Vision said the Vietnamese government had shut down airports, schools and power in the Danang area, three hours from Hue.

Danang is predicted to be in the eye of the storm. ""It's very windy, and trees have already blown down,"" said Le Van Duong, World Vision's emergency response coordinator in Danang.

""We have seen the evacuation of 3,000 families from our project areas to safer places, including schools, and we have already distributed noodle packs to 700 families.""

Ketsana left at least 246 people dead as it passed over the Philippines. Another 38 people were missing, according to the nation's National Disaster Coordinating Council. Nearly 2 million people were affected by the killer storm, and 567,000 people had been evacuated.

Several nations, including the United States, Australia, Japan and China, have donated money for relief supplies. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the United Nations was considering an emergency appeal for aid as several U.N. agencies pledged support. The World Food Program said it would provide rations to 180,000 people.

Manila, on the island of Luzon, and the nearby province of Rizal bore the brunt of the storm. People huddled on rooftops waiting on army helicopters to pluck them to safety. Others used ropes to wade through waist-deep muddy waters.

Power and water supplies failed in some areas. Roads were rendered impassable, making rescue efforts challenging.

Ketsana is expected to move west across Vietnam into neighboring Laos and Thailand.

94,"(CNN) -- A legal defense fund for Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, charged with 17 murders in a shooting rampage in an Afghan village, has been established, his wife said Saturday.

With the support of Bales' extended family, wife Kari formed The Staff Sergeant Robert Bales Legal Defense Fund, she said in a statement Saturday.

Regarding the alleged March 11 massacre in Afghanistan, Kari Bales said she ""has no more information about what happened other than what the government and media have released.""

She said she ""cannot even come close to covering the legal costs and fees that will accrue.""

""Contributions to the defense fund are welcome only from donors who (1.) grieve with Mrs. Bales over the lives that were lost that night, and (2.) believe that in America everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Over time, the truth will come out. That's why we have due process under the laws of our country. Unfortunately, due process is very expensive,"" Kari Bales' statement said.

Contributions to the defense fund, at P.O. Box 2774, Seattle, Washington, 98111, aren't tax deductible, she said.

In addition to the 17 charges of murder ""with premeditation,"" 38-year-old Staff Sgt. Bales faces six counts of attempted murder and two counts of assault.

Authorities say Bales left a remote outpost in Kandahar province's Panjwai district early March 11 and went house-to-house, gunning down villagers.

U.S. and Afghan officials initially said 16 people died in those attacks.

Col. Gary Kolb, a spokesman with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, on Friday said only that investigators assigned to the case felt they had evidence to charge Bales with 17 counts of murder. There was no immediate indication as to where the other fatality came from, besides the fact it was an adult, and Afghan government officials in Kabul have said they have no record of another death.

The six people wounded in the shootings are four children, one woman and one man, according to the charge sheet against Bales. Two of those have been released from a hospital, said Ahmad Javed Faisal, a Kandahar provincial government spokesman.

At the minimum, Bales would be sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole if he's convicted on even one of the 17 murder charges, according to a statement from the U.S. Forces-Afghanistan public affairs office.

At the maximum, he could face the death penalty.

The Taliban, in an e-mail Friday to CNN, vowed ""strong revenge"" for the attacks and claimed justice won't be served in U.S. courts, which they said ""are not reliable."" The Islamic fundamentalist group, which been battling coalition and Afghan government forces for years, believes that ""tens of American soldiers, and not one person"" are responsible for the killings, according to the message.

""We don't believe in these (American) courts and reject the decision,"" the Taliban said. ""We will take practical revenge on every single American soldier.""

Bales, who was returned to the United States last week, is being held at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

95,"Two weeks ago I visited the Africa Village at London's Kensington Gardens, to appear on a radio show being broadcast from there. After the interview, I lingered, wandering around the national stands, savoring the Nigerian hip-hop that blared from the speakers. I stood in line to receive an inscription -- carefully traced out on paper by a cheerful, elderly man wielding a quill pen -- of my name in English and Arabic.

So you can imagine my shock when I heard news of the premature closure of the Village -- fallout of a debt row involving the company managing events at the village, and a key supplier.

For me that tragic turn of events symbolizes all that is wrong with sports administration in many African countries. Government funds meant to help Nigeria's contingent prepare for London 2012 -- a total of $14 million, according to Sports Minister Bolaji Abdullahi -- weren't released to the ministry until April, just three months before the opening ceremony.

Abdullahi himself was only drafted to the ministry in December 2011, in an acting capacity; his substantive appointment was not announced until May.

Now I'm not a sports technocrat, but something in the realm of common sense suggests to me that the Olympics are generally won and lost long before the opening ceremony cauldron is touched by fire.

Watch: Games medals versus GDP

Nigeria, an unrepentantly heavy trader in the stock market of optimism, went to London the way it likes to travel to global engagements (be they sporting events or climate change summits) -- eschewing serious preparation, expecting the best, and inevitably attracting the worst, which actually varies in degree depending on the amount of good luck in the air.

In the end, the opening ceremony march-past turned out to be the high point of our London 2012 performance. From a tally of four medals in Beijing (1 silver and 3 bronze) we dropped into medal-less oblivion in London.

As with Nigeria, so has it been with Ghana (Ghana's last Olympic medal was its Barcelona 1992 bronze in the men's soccer event).

Kenya, with a much better Olympic record, has also disappointed in London. The east African country, 13th on the medals table four years ago, with a total of 14 medals, all in long-distance athletics (six of which were golds), dropped to 28th place in London, with 11 medals (only two of which were golds).

From the tales of woe filtering out from the various national camps one might be forgiven for assuming it's the same set of officials managing the Nigerians, Ghanaians and the Kenyans.

Cameroon's problems are of a slightly different nature -- seven of its athletes vanished from camp two weeks into the Games, presumably envisaging brighter prospects as asylum-seekers than as home-bound Olympians.

Across the continent there will be much handwringing and gnashing of teeth in the weeks and months to come. Governments will set up probe panels and probe panels to probe those probe panels.

Two years ago, after Nigeria's disastrous outing at the 2010 World Cup, President Goodluck Jonathan, still fresh in office, fired the football federation board and placed a two-year ban on Nigeria's participation in international football competitions. The purpose of that ban, according to a presidential spokesperson, was to ""enable us put our house in order and enable us work out a more meaningful way to engage the global stage in terms of football so that this kind of rather embarrassing outcome we had in South Africa will not repeat itself.""

Two years on, our embarrassments have grown muscle and wings. Like Usain Bolt recycling his wins with a certainty bordering on the surreal, we have made a spectacle of recycling our sporting failures. Different arenas, same scenarios.

I shouldn't be too negative. It's perhaps not a totally hopeless situation. In a recent interview a chastened minister Abdullahi was quoted as saying: ""If we want to win and compete sustainably, we have to develop systems that establish clear connection between process and outcome.""

Sadly systems are something Nigeria is not very good at or keen on building or sustaining. But for now we'll have to trust that the reform-minded minister has it all planned out. ""Failure can have a galvanising effect. And, I believe it is easier to deal with failure than to deal with success. This failure is an opportunity to do the right thing,"" he went on to say.

I bet he knows only too well that failure also presents an opportunity to fail again, and fail worse. Which is where the bulk of Nigeria's experience lies.

Watch: Looking back at London 2012

Abdullahi will have to do several things all at once -- fight mafias and cabals for whom self-enrichment is the pre-eminent sport, enlist private sector funding (long stifled by corruption) on a larger scale, rebuild a comatose school sports, raise the standard of the National Sports Festival, and offer his unconditional support to the Segun Odegbamis and Mobolaji Akiodes and others who, against many odds, and often in spite of the government, are striving to build the next generation of sporting talent.

None of these will be easy. If the past is anything to go by, time is not on his side. And this is not only because the countdown to Rio 2016 has started. Since democracy returned to Nigeria in 1999, we've had a total of 12 ministers for sport, translating to a new minister roughly every 12 months.

Going by that arithmetic, Abdullahi and his lofty dreams already have their expiry date bearing down on them with the speed of Usain Bolt, and the deadly accuracy of Yi Siling. He will therefore be needing large doses of good fortune; the sort that every now and then transforms an underdog into an Olympic champion.

96,"A train crash in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, that killed at least 80 people and injured 178 more Wednesday poses many questions for investigators, who are homing in on what role the train's speed may have played in the crash.

The issue of high-speed rail may raise more questions for the public at large, specifically in the United States, where high-speed trains are rare. Here are some basics on this speedy mode of transportation:

What is high-speed rail?

It depends where you are, but the International Union of Railways says the term is reserved for systems (not just trains) designed for speeds of more than 250 kph (155 mph) if the lines are new and speeds up to 220 kph (137 mph) if the lines are upgraded.

Certain trains in China and the European Union can exceed 300 kph (186 mph), while a handful around the world can top 400 kph (249 mph).

The term can also be used for trains that move at speeds between 110 kph and 180 kph (68 mph to 112 mph) in certain circumstances, such as the need to avoid ""noise and nuisance,"" or the need to traverse long tunnels or bridges.

How is high-speed rail different from nation to nation?

As stated above, China and the EU have trains that can exceed 300 kph (186 mph), which means, in China, trains can zip between Beijing and Wuhan in about five hours. The regular train route takes twice as long, and you'd be lucky to finish the journey in a car in 13 hours.

In Japan, the Shinkansen bullet trains typically travel at between 270 kph (169 mph) and 320 kph (199 mph), while Korea Train Express cars can travel up to 305 kph (190 mph).

In March, Korea's HEMU-430X hit a speed of 421.4 kph (261.8 mph) in a test run, making Korea the fourth country -- behind France, China and Japan -- to develop a train capable of topping 420 kph (261 mph).

Spain has high-speed trains, known as AVEs, that move at speeds up to 310 kph (193 mph), according to Railway Gazette, but the train involved in this week's wreck was not an AVE. It had a max speed of 250 kph (155 mph).

Is high-speed rail available in the United States?

Amtrak operates a service in the northeastern United States called Acela Express that is capable of speeds up to 241 kph (150 mph) and can travel between New York City and Washington in about 96 minutes. Other stops on the route include Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and New Haven, Connecticut.

Responding to critics who say Acela is too slow and too infrequently reaches its top speed, Amtrak announced in September that it plans to run test trains at  266 kph (165 mph) in Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

What does the future hold for high-speed rail in the U.S.?

Early in the Obama administration, federal transportation officials called on states to spend money to develop faster rail systems using existing lines.

The plan identified 10 potential high-speed corridors for federal funding, and the White House proposed spending $53 billion over 25 years to create the national network. Among the corridors: California, the Pacific Northwest, the Midwest, the Southeast, the Gulf Coast, Pennsylvania, Florida, New York and New England. The blueprint envisioned some trains traveling at top speeds of more than 150 mph.

But there have been many snafus.

In 2010, Transportation Secretary Roy LaHood redirected $810 million from Wisconsin and $400 million from Ohio after those states' governors cited opposition to the projects.

The tussle over budget cuts further hampered funding in 2011. That same year, Florida Gov. Rick Scott rejected a plan to run high-speed rail between Tampa and Orlando (and eventually spread to Miami and Jacksonville). Florida subsequently lost $2.4 billion in federal funding, and 24 states submitted requests for portions of Florida's allotted money.

In California, billions of federal dollars were pledged for high-speed rail, and voters OK'd $9 billion in bonds for a bullet train between San Diego and San Francisco, but the project has been set back by myriad issues.

Are there safeguards in place in the U.S. that would help prevent a disaster like the one in Spain?

Yes. In fact, those safety regulations may be at the core of why it's difficult for high-speed rail to proliferate in the United States.

According to a June report from the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank, the Federal Railroad Administration ""has strict crash safety regulation for passenger railcars which trains in Europe -- where passenger rail is well established and remarkably safe -- do not have to meet.""

While the U.S. requires the undercarriage of a train to withstand 800,000 pounds of force without ""permanent deformation,"" Europe designs ""trains to gracefully deform in a controlled manner"" so that crumple zones absorb the energy of the crash, an approach known as crash-energy management.

The ""buff-strength"" for European trains is 337,200 pounds of force, according to the think tank.

The FRA has other requirements not present in European safety regulations, including requiring that the end of the train have the resistive strength of a half-inch plate of steel and an ""anti-climbing mechanism"" that prevents train cars from telescoping and mounting each other.

""The requirements force Amtrak and transit authorities across the country to purchase custom-made trains that are unnecessarily expensive, underperform and do not meet the best safety practices of the rest of the world,"" the CEI report said.

97,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Bibi Aisha, a young Afghan wife whose ears and nose were cut off by her husband, is heading to the United States on Wednesday for reconstructive surgery.

Aisha made headlines and was on a recent cover of Time magazine, showing the plight of women in Afghanistan.

""When they cut off my nose and ears, I passed out,"" Aisha said, describing the attack. ""It felt like there was cold water in my nose. I opened my eyes, and I couldn't even see because of all the blood.""

But she survived.

With the help of an American provincial reconstruction team in Oruzgan province and the organization Women for Afghan Women, she finally received the help and protection she needed.

And now she is on her way to the United States, where the Grossman Burn Foundation will provide her with reconstructive surgery and a new life.

Read a behind-the-scenes with Aisha then and now

Aisha says her mutilation was an act of Taliban justice for the crime of shaming her husband's family.

At 16, she was handed over to her husband's father and 10 brothers, who she claims were all members of the Taliban in Oruzgan.

""I spent two years with them and became a prisoner,"" she said.

Read more about Aisha's story

She eventually ran away but was caught by police in Kandahar. And although running away is not a crime, in places throughout Afghanistan, it is treated as one if you are a woman. Eventually her father-in-law found her and took her back to her abusive home.

She was taken to a Taliban court for dishonoring her husband's family and bringing them shame. The court ruled that her nose and ears must be cut off, an act carried out by her husband in the mountains of Oruzgan, where they left her to die.

After Aisha's story was exposed to the world through various news organizations, offers of help poured in.

But there are many more women still suffering.

The United Nations estimates that nearly 90 percent of Afghanistan's women face some sort of domestic abuse. This in a country where there are fewer than a dozen women's shelters providing sanctuary from the cruelty they face. And all of them are privately run.

""Bibi Aisha is only one example of thousands of girls and women in Afghanistan and throughout the world who are treated this way. Who suffer abuses like this -- like this and worse,"" Women for Afghan Women board member Esther Hyneman said.

In 2001, the situation of Afghan women and Taliban brutality received lots of attention. Now, organizations like Women for Afghan Women say, the international community is strangely silent on the issue.

And with the Afghan government's plans to negotiate with some of the Taliban -- supported by many in the international community -- many fear that it will be the women who will pay the price.

Hyneman says that not enough is being done to help the women in Afghanistan, and that feeds into the hands of the Taliban.

Aisha is reminded of that every time she looks in the mirror.

But at least now she will be going to the United States for a chance at a new life.

And just like the iconic picture of an Afghan girl on a 1985 National Geographic cover brought the plight of Afghan women under Soviet oppression to the world's attention, many hope Aisha's face can show the new plight under the Taliban.

98,"(CNN) -- Tennis star Maria Sharapova has been handed the honor of becoming the first woman to carry Russia's flag at the opening ceremony of an Olympic Games.

The 25-year-old will be competing in her first Olympics at London 2012, where she will play in the women's singles tournament.

""I wasn't aware that I am the first woman but what a personal honor to be representing Russia,"" she told CNN.

""I am grateful for the sincere support from my family, friends and fans from home and across the globe. I'm truly proud and humbled to represent a country that is full of hopes and dreams.""

Sharapova has battled her way back to the top of women's tennis after two years of shoulder problems, returning to No. 1 in the world rankings after completing a career grand slam by winning last month's French Open.

She lost top spot to Victoria Azarenka of Belarus this week after a surprise defeat in the fourth round at Wimbledon dropped her to No. 3, but has the chance to make amends as the Olympic event will also be held at the famous grass-court venue.

""This year's upcoming Olympics in London holds special meaning to me as this will be my first foray into the Games,"" Sharapova said.

""It's a remarkable opportunity to not only compete in such a historically prestigious sporting moment, but I am looking forward to sharing this Olympic experience with fellow athletes around the world.""

Sharapova, who will reportedly marry basketball star Sasha Vujacic in November after the end of the tennis season, has been based in the United States for most of her life.

She has played three times for Russia's Fed Cup team, all in quarterfinal ties, winning three of her four singles rubbers.

Sharapova did not qualify for the 2004 Olympics in Beijing, despite winning her first grand slam title at Wimbledon as a 17-year-old. She missed out in Beijing in 2008 due to injury, and compatriot Elena Dementieva -- who has since retired -- won the women's gold.

Russia first took part at the Summer Olympics in 1912, but did not appear again until 1952 as the Soviet Union. Since then the honor of carrying the flag has usually gone to male gold medal-winners.

This year, Serbia and Spain will also have a tennis star as flag-bearer as men's world No. 2 Novak Djokovic and Beijing champion Rafael Nadal have been given the role by their respective countries.

99,"(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton's book roll-out the past few days has shown, as expected, that she still commands an army of rapturous fans, but the best news for her this week came from the completely unexpected: the defeat of Republican leader Eric Cantor.

Rarely has a GOP primary for a seat in the House of Representatives had such wide repercussions. For Clinton, they almost all run in her favor. Consider just three:

(1) Prior to the Cantor defeat, the GOP ""establishment"" thought they were starting to persuade middle-of-the-road voters that their party is not hostage to the tea party. After all, GOP establishment candidates so far this year have won five of seven Senate primaries where they were challenged by tea party candidates, most notably Mitch McConnell's victory in Kentucky. A public narrative was emerging that tea partiers remained a potent and, yes, welcome force in the GOP but that they aren't in charge.

The defeat of Cantor was a thunderclap transforming the landscape. Because Cantor is perceived as a strong conservative, and yet lost to an unknown on his right, the narrative has changed: Now the story line is that the GOP base is not only angry but demands even tougher conservatism and even less compromise.

All this plays directly into Clinton's hands. If she formally declares, she can now stand before the electorate and assert with greater credibility that she -- not the GOP -- represents sensibility and moderation, a leader eager to work across the aisle. She even has greater latitude to embrace some of Elizabeth Warren's positions, appealing to the rise of a populist left, so long as she doesn't veer too far from the middle (where most voters still are).

(2) Cantor's defeat all but extinguishes lingering hopes that Congress and President Obama can work out a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform. Two post-election polls have suggested that Cantor's perceived openness to immigration reform was not the decisive factor in his defeat, but his opponent certainly seized on immigration as a stick to beat him over the head as an out-of-touch, wrong-headed reform advocate.

In the wake of his defeat, it's hard to see how other Republican incumbents will follow Cantor's path. And for starters, they will likely be very wary of voting for immigration reform until dust settles.

That, of course, is bad news for the GOP presidential nominee in 2016 and good news for Clinton if she is the Democratic standard bearer. Mitt Romney could only garner 27% of the Hispanic vote in 2012, far below the 40% that pundits think is mandatory for victory. Unless it finds a way out of the cul de sac, the GOP share could sink even lower this time.

Opinion: Should Clinton embrace Obama's foreign policy?

(3) We haven't yet heard from that corner, but one can only imagine that the Cantor defeat, tied so closely to charges that he was for ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants, is prompting second thoughts by Jeb Bush and his many admirers about whether 2016 is the right year for him to run. If Bush's deep belief in immigration reform would tear apart his party in the primaries and make his path to the White House perilous at best, why should he?

If Jeb Bush decides not to go, that would be extremely welcome news to the Clinton camp. From the point of view of Democrats, the most obvious threat to a Clinton victory is a Republican governor conservative enough to unite his party but moderate and experienced enough to pull in purple states. Jeb Bush and Chris Christie are the two who come closest to that profile.

Conservatives may disagree -- many genuinely believe that a Rand Paul can win -- but Democrats will quietly celebrate if neither Bush nor Christie tops the Republican ticket.

It is an oddity of American democracy that a tiny number of voters -- fewer than 8,000 -- in a suburb of Richmond, Virginia, can substantially alter the national outlook. But we live in odd, unpredictable times. No doubt other big surprises lie ahead before November 2016.

100,"London (CNN) -- Following a year in which ""people power"" was the rallying cry from the Arab Spring to the Occupy movement, the annual World Economic Forum might seem an elitist anomaly.

Never mind the 1%, this is the 0.00004%: around 2,600 of the world's top political and business leaders, coming together to address the big issues -- most pressingly, the eurozone debt crisis -- in the luxurious surrounds of a Swiss ski resort.

Among those gathering in Europe's highest-altitude town from January 25 to 29 will be royalty from Saudi Arabia, Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands, billionaires like philanthropist George Soros, senior executives from Facebook, Google and other tech giants, and the leaders of countries including Germany, South Africa, Mexico, and the world's youngest nation, South Sudan.

While admission is free for heads of state, civil society or faith leaders and international organizations, among others, those paying will face a $20,000 price tag for admission, plus other costs which can easily push the bill to $40,000. But the true barrier to entry is having the power and influence to secure a ""white badge"" of invitation, the only means of admission to this most exclusive of clubs.

As undemocratic as the event may seem, the forum's architects say that the current global atmosphere of unrest will give discussions an even greater significance. This year's theme is ""The great transformation: shaping new models.""

Klaus Schwab, the German economist who founded the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 1971, says new decision-making models are needed to account for changed global realities. The WEF has cautioned that the backlash against rising inequality, seen in the discontent behind the Occupy movement and the Arab Spring, risks derailing globalization and constitutes a threat to economies worldwide. Amidst the turmoil of the current economic environment, emphasis needs to be placed on finding new models for assessing the quality of economic growth -- ensuring it is both sustainable and inclusive.

Given rising youth unemployment -- in Spain, Europe's worst affected country, joblessness among young people stands at about 45% -- a new model for job creation is also needed. ""For the first time in generations, many people no longer believe that their children will grow up to enjoy a higher standard of living than theirs,"" said Lee Howell, the WEF managing director behind the Forum's Global Risks 2012 report.

The key to avoiding catastrophe, Schwab argues in a discussion paper, is ""to provide young people with the capability to create their own jobs: to move from the pure concept of unemployment to the concept of micro-entrepreneurship.""

Those who dismiss the forum as an ineffectual talk-fest for the wealthy and privileged may point to the thematic similarities with previous years' forums as evidence that the event does little to actually implement change towards its stated ends.

It's certainly true that the problems that have given a more austere tone to proceedings in recent years have only endured, or worsened, since the world's elite last visited Davos. At least this year's discussions will not want for a sense of urgency.

Delegates will meet against the backdrop of the eurozone debt crisis, with European nations bickering over the fiscal compact they hope will be their salvation. But ahead of the EU summit which immediately follows Davos on January 30, the situation remains bleak.

France and Austria recently lost their prized AAA credit ratings in a downgrade by Standard & Poor's which affected seven other eurozone nations. Budget deficit numbers for Greece, the country which triggered the current crisis, are getting worse, while crucial talks between the country's government and its creditors on debt haircuts have struck difficulties.

The world's largest economy suffered the same indignity as France when, in an unprecedented move, the U.S.was stripped of AAA status in August. This followed of months of uncertainty stemming from the political paralysis over raising the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, the resolution of which meant the country narrowly avoided a potentially calamitous default.

And, a year on from its outbreak, the failure of the Arab Spring to deliver dividends has some questioning whether it really constitutes a new dawn. In Egypt, unemployment is at a decade-long high, tourism is down by a quarter, the Cairo Stock Exchange was 2011's worst performer and the once celebrated military has been recast as a villain. The success of Islamist parties on the new political landscape of the Middle East has disappointed some secularists and liberals, and raised concerns about the social changes that could ensue.

For those in attendance, Davos will provide an opportunity not just to air opinions, but perhaps also to build a consensus on how to approach these new realities. The real action will be conducted behind the scenes, at exclusive cocktail parties and black-tie events in the town's most expensive hotels. Eventually though, from the muted hum of discussions, a better sense of the global agenda for the year ahead will emerge, even for those of us without white badges.

101,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Military divers have found the body of a U.S. paratrooper who went missing last week in a river in western Afghanistan.

The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said the soldier was found close to where he disappeared November 4. Officials are continuing their search for a second paratrooper lost at the same time.

Both men -- from the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division -- disappeared in the Morghab River near Afghanistan's border with Turkmenistan. The men were on a routine resupply mission, the NATO group said.

Family members identified the recovered body as that of Benjamin Sherman, 21, of Plymouth, Massachusetts.

They said he jumped into the river when he saw a fellow soldier struggling in the water.

""I know that day he jumped into the river to try to save his comrade was because he didn't just see another soldier in the water; he saw his brother,"" said Sherman's sister, Meredith, in a statement to CNN affiliate WCVB in Boston, Massachusetts.

""He didn't jump in because he was trained to but because that's what his heart told him to do.""

Sherman's mother, Denise, said the family called him ""the unstoppable one.""

""I raised him with the understanding that when you choose to do something, you do it to the best of your ability,"" she said in a statement to WCVB. ""He was powerful, ingenuous and determined.""

102,"(CNN) -- The international governing body for athletics urged caution Friday after reports that the world-champion South African runner Caster Semenya has both male and female organs.

The front cover of You magazine shows Semenya after a recent makeover.

The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia and The Sun newspaper in Britain reported that gender tests ordered by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) show the 18-year-old is a hermaphrodite.

Neither paper named the source of their information. IAAF spokesman Nick Davies would not discuss the findings with CNN. ""I simply haven't seen the results,"" Davies said.

""We have received the results from Germany, but they now need to be examined by a group of experts and we will not be in a position to speak to the athlete about them for at least a few weeks.

""After that, depending on the results, we will meet privately with the athlete to discuss further action."" Has Semenya been treated fairly?

The IAAF issued a statement, saying no decision on the case will be announced until the experts can look at the results.

A final decision regarding the case is not expected before the IAAF Council meets in late November in Monaco, the IAAF said.

Davies also said the news reports should be treated with caution. The newspapers said extensive physical examinations of Semenya show she has no ovaries, but rather has internal testes, which are producing large amounts of testosterone. What is intersexuality?

Semenya won the women's 800-meters gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin last month.

She crushed her rivals by streaking away to secure victory in 1 minute, 55.45 seconds -- the best women's time in the world this year.

Defending champion Janeth Jepkosgei of Kenya took the silver and Jennifer Meadows of Britain claimed bronze.

The IAAF said it was seeking tests on Semenya's gender even before that race. Davies said questions about her were first raised after her astonishing displays at the African junior championships in July, with her masculine build and surprising performance fueling the rumors.

South Africans reacted angrily to Friday's reports, with one newspaper headline declaring ""outrage.""

Sport and Recreation Minister Makhenkesi Stofile said he was ""shocked and disgusted"" at the treatment that Semenya has received from the media, the IAAF, and the world.

""She may be a hermaphrodite, but so what? She is still a girl,"" Stofile told a news conference in Pretoria.

Even if Semenya has an unfortunate ""proportion of hormones,"" he said, she is still ""a young girl enjoying growing up."" Stofile said he believes the teenager's human rights have been violated and that she was not given a chance to understand what the gender testing was all about.

South Africa will fight back if Semenya is excluded from further competition, Stofile said, adding, ""It will be a third world war.""

All indications were Friday that, at the very least, Semenya may be able to keep the gold medal she won in Berlin.

""Our legal advice is that, if she proves to have an advantage because of the male hormones, then it will be extremely difficult to strip the medal off her, since she has not cheated,"" Davies told CNN.

Semenya's countrymen -- including her father and the South Africa team manager -- have maintained that Semenya is a female.

Thousands of supporters crammed the airport in Johannesburg when she returned from Berlin last month. And this week, the athlete appeared on the cover of a South African magazine wearing makeup, jewelry and a glamorous dress.

Under IAAF rules, any time there is suspicion about an athlete's gender, the athlete can be asked to attend a medical evaluation before a panel consisting of a gynecologist, an endocrinologist, a psychologist, an internal medicine specialist and an expert on gender issues.

There are chromosome tests and scans of the athlete's body, Davies has said. He called gender verification -- which is generally required only for female athletes -- ""an extremely complex procedure.""

The process of gender verification has undergone big changes since it was first introduced for international competition in the 1960s, the IAAF said.

The first mechanism involved ""rather crude and perhaps humiliating physical examinations,"" which soon gave way to mouth swabs to collect chromosomes, the IAAF said.

There were too many uncertainties regarding the mouth swabs, so the IAAF abandoned them in 1991 and the International Olympic Committee discontinued them in 2000, the IAAF said.

A proper test has yet to be found, the IAAF said, and the current round of tests is considered a good interim solution.

103,"(CNN) -- University of Missouri head football coach Gary Pinkel has been suspended for a week and docked another week's pay after his arrest on a drunken-driving charge, the university's athletics director announced Thursday.

Pinkel, 59, was released on $500 bail after his arrest in Columbia, about 120 miles west of St. Louis, according to Boone County sheriff's department records. His unpaid suspension took effect Thursday afternoon, Athletics Director Mike Alden told reporters.

And when Pinkel comes back, he will have to donate his next weekly salary to the school's Wellness Resource Center, which presents alcohol-awareness programs to students. He will also have to issue a public letter of apology; perform 50 hours of community service; forfeit any bonus if the Tigers make it into a bowl game; and see his salary frozen for a year.

""He's a tremendous guy, and he's got great character and he was unbelievably remorseful, as I would expect him to be,"" Alden said. But Pinkel's actions were ""certainly not consistent"" with values of the institution.

""This absolutely goes against everything that we stand for and everything he teaches his players in regards to our social responsibilities,"" he said.

In a statement issued Thursday morning, Pinkel said he was stopped by a deputy after having dinner with friends and was ""very disappointed in myself for my lack of judgment.""

""Nobody should drink and drive, including me,"" he said. ""My staff and I constantly reinforce with each of our players the importance of not putting yourself into a position such as this. I did not follow that here, and for that, I sincerely apologize to the University of Missouri, to our administration, to the Board of Curators and to our fans.""

Pinkel is in his 11th season at the helm of Mizzou, which has a 5-5 record overall and is 3-4 in the Big 12 conference. Assistant coach Dave Steckel will lead the team into Saturday's game against Texas Tech.

Pinkel said he has apologized to players and staff for his conduct.

""I accept full responsibility for my actions and will abide by whatever course of action our leadership deems appropriate,"" he said.

104,"Washington (CNN) -- A second grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of an unarmed black man once again had ripple effects that quickly spread from the streets on New York City to reach the halls of Capitol Hill.

The decision not to indict a New York City police officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a black man who was suspected of illegally selling cigarettes, came just nine days after another grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri in the death of black teenager Michael Brown. The news led to another night of protests in major cities nationwide, including Washington, D.C. President Barack Obama vowed not to ""let up"" in his efforts to ease racial tensions, and some Democrats tried to channel demonstrators' outrage in their reactions overnight and into Thursday morning.

And it was a rare development that brought members of both parties together in calling for further investigation. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, chairwoman of the House Republican Conference, said Thursday morning that the House should ""absolutely"" hold hearings to investigate Garner's death.

""We all have a lot of serious questions that need to be addressed and we need to understand what happened, why this decision was made,"" McMorris Rodgers said on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

""I would call for the House to have those hearings so that we can better understand. But we need to take action, appropriate action, making sure our local law enforcement have the training, that they're using appropriate force, whichâ€”I think we all recognize these are tragedies and it has raised a lot of questions.""

Referring to Rodgers' call for hearings, House Speaker John Boehner said he would not ""rule that in or out,"" but said there are ""a lot of unanswered questions that Americans have, and frankly I have.""

""I do think that the American people deserve more answers about what really happened here and was our system of justice handled properly,"" Boehner said Thursday during a press conference.

Black leaders in Congress quickly slammed the decision not to indict New York City police officer Daniel Pantaleo in Garner's death and called on the Department of Justice to investigate Garner's death.

Rep. Marcia Fudge, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Wednesday she was ""deeply disappointed"" in the decision not to indict Pantaleo in Garner's death and called the grand jury's decision ""yet another sad day for our country and our democracy.""

""In the span of two weeks, this nation seems to have heard one message loud and clear: there will be no accountability for taking Black lives. As an American, it is growing increasingly difficult to believe that there is justice for all,"" she said in a statement. ""Black lives do matter and our lives do hold value.""

Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the black caucus' incoming whip who represents parts of New York City, called the grand jury's decision a ""stunning miscarriage of justice"" in a statement Wednesday and said the decision ""makes clear that equal protection under the law does not exist for all Americans.""

And Jeffries said Thursday that the incidents should serve as a catalyst for a wide shakeup in how cases involving police misconduct and potential crimes should be prosecuted.

""We need to look at broader reform and whether these type of cases should be handled by independent, special prosecutors so that we can have some measure of fairness and a real full and fair investigation,"" Jeffries said on CNN's New Day.

Jeffries called the altercation between Garner and the police officer, which was caught on video, a ""living breathing example of probable cause to indict."" Nearly a dozen times, Garner tries telling the officer that he can't breathe and Jeffries noted that Garner ""even put his hands up in the air,"" but Pantaleo ""continued to choke him.""

Protests featuring slogans like ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" ""Black lives matter"" and now ""I can't breathe"" broke out again Wednesday in reaction to the Staten Island grand jury's decision as demonstrators called for justice for Garner and Brown, the black teenager who was shot by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson this summer.

Amid outcry from Democrats on Capitol Hill and mostly silence from Congressional Republicans, two New York GOP Congressman defended the grand jury's decision Wednesday not to indict NYPD officer Pantaleo.

Rep. Peter King thanked the grand jury on Twitter ""for doing justice"" and said later on CNN that he felt ""strongly"" the police officer should not have been indicted.

RELATED: Rep. Peter King thanks Staten Island grand jury for 'doing justice'

Rep. Michael Grimm, who represents Staten Island in Congress, called the grand jury decision ""fair and reasoned"" in a statement Wednesday and thanked the District Attorney in the incident for handling the grand jury case ""with the utmost integrity."" Staten Island is New York's whitest burrough and a majority of the grand jurors in the case were white.

Grimm did not fare so well at the hands of another grand jury last spring, when he was indicted on tax and other fraud charges.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder heeded calls from Congressional leaders to launch a federal investigation and later Wednesday formally announced that the Justice Department is leading a civil rights investigation into Garner's death.

President Obama had also weighed in Wednesday saying he had spoken with Holder and said ""we are not going to let up until we see a strengthening of the trust and a strengthening of accountability that exists between our communities and law enforcement.""

Holder's announcement came after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York joined members of the Congressional Black Caucus in calling on the Justice Department to investigate the Staten Island death.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand called the decision ""shocking"" and called Garner's death a ""tragedy that demands accountability.""

""Nobody unarmed should die on a New York City street corner for suspected low-level offenses,"" she said in a statement.

U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch, Obama's nominee to succeed Holder as U.S. Attorney General, will lead the investigation into Garner's death.

Sen. Chuck Schumer, also of New York, said he was confident Lynch will ""conduct a tough but fair investigation into the tragic death of Eric Garner.""

Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican and would-be 2016 presidential contender who has specialized in reaching out to minority voters, blamed high taxes on cigarettes in the Empire State as partially to blame for putting police officers in ""a dangerous situation with bad laws.""

105,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- California Gov. Jerry Brown will seek an immediate stay of what he called an ""unprecedented"" federal court order to release almost 10,000 inmates to relieve prison overcrowding by the end of the year, he said Thursday.

A three-judge federal court panel ordered the state to reduce its prison population to 137.5% of design capacity by December 31 and threatened to find the state in contempt if California does not report on its progress every two weeks, Thursday's ruling said.

California has the nation's largest prison system and says it has been reducing overcrowding.

The case grows out of lawsuits filed in 1990 and 2001 that alleged overcrowding is at the core of a domino effect of unsafe and unhealthy conditions for those on both sides of the iron bars. When plaintiffs filed motions to convene the three-judge court panel in November 2006, California's prisons were at 202% of design capacity.

In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a three-judge federal panel's determination that California's medical and mental health care for inmates falls below a constitutional level of care and that the only way to meet the requirements is by reducing prison crowding.

The Supreme Court in 2011 found that California's shortcomings in prison medical and mental health care resulted in ""needless suffering and death"" and recognized the federal court's prison reduction order was ""of unprecedented sweep and extent,"" Thursday's ruling said. The high court affirmed that order in full in 2011.

On Thursday, the three U.S. District Court judges expressed impatience with California officials, the defendants in the case.

""The history of this litigation is of defendants' repeated failure to take the necessary steps to remedy the constitutional violations in its prison system,"" the order said. ""It is defendants' unwillingness to comply with this Court's orders that requires us to order additional relief today.""

The three-judge panel added that the plaintiffs' request for a court order to show why California shouldn't be held in contempt ""has considerable merit.""

""Our first priority, however, is to eliminate the deprivation of constitutional liberties in the California prison system,"" the three judges said in their ruling. ""We will therefore DEFER ruling on plaintiffs' motion, and defer instituting any contempt proceedings related to defendants' prior acts until after we are able to determine whether defendants will comply with this order.""

Court documents also show that ""DEFER"" was not only all capitalized but also printed in bold face.

106,"Norfolk, Virginia (CNN)The second mate of the Houston Express probably couldn't believe what he was seeing.

Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned.

It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked.

Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help.

""He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition,"" Capt. Thomas Grenz told CNN by phone Friday.

That man, Louis Jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving Conway, South Carolina, to fish in the ocean.

Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away.

Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents.

""It took so long,"" Jordan said.  ""It moved so slowly.""

The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan.

His father, Frank Jordan, told CNN's Jim Sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different.

""He looked good. Hadn't lost too much weight. He wasn't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be,"" he said.

Lost at sea for 66 days

After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival.

Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the Carolinas during the time he was missing. The precipitation came at night during harsh conditions.

""I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat,"" Jordan said.  ""The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad.

""Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket.""

Then there was the issue of food.

The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse.

The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said.

Jordan came ashore Thursday evening.

CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital about 7:30 p.m.

Coast Guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt Jordan's incredible story. They noted that his father contacted them January 29 to report his son and his boat missing.

Frank Jordan addressed the skepticism about his son's appearance, saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time. His son spent most of his days in the cabin, out of the sun.

Frank Jordan said it was obvious when the Jordans met at the hospital Friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal.

""I know he went through what he went through,"" Frank Jordan said.

Jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in Conway. He had free rent and free food in the river, he said. But when it became difficult to catch dinner, he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish.

Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it.

""He's got a very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually,"" Frank Jordan said. ""And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal.""

Rescue swimmer Kyle McCollum was the first to care for Jordan on the flight back to land.

""You would expect sunburns, severe sunburn, blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him,"" he said. ""But for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing.""

Grenz was also surprised by Jordan's condition, physically and mentally. The rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was, remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days.

Jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry.

""We took him to a rescue boat,"" the container ship captain said. ""He was given water and pea soup to gain some power again.""

Derriel Morris, a neighbor at the Bucksport Plantation Marina & RV Resort called Jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat, named ""Angel.""

Morris said: ""It was immaculate, it was gorgeous, beautifully painted. I mean it looked like a brand new sailboat.""

Morris told CNN affiliate WPDE that one day in January he was going to the store and Jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer. But when he returned to the marina, Jordan had slipped away.

""There was no shore line, no hose; it was like he was never there,"" Morris told the station.

After he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony.

The marina's manager, Jeff Weeks, told WPDE that Jordan is expected to be back at Buscksport next week.

107,"(RealSimple.com) -- Tired of counting sheep? Try one of these remedies and get a good night's sleep.

Aromatherapy

Try it: When you're drowsy but slightly tense.

How to use it: Massage a dab of aromatherapeutic balm or oil into the back of your neck and shoulders (and inhale deeply) before you hit the sack. Certain fragrances, including lavender and lemon balm, promote snooze-inducing relaxation, says Rubin Naiman, Ph.D., a sleep specialist at the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, in Tucson. (Try Dr. Andrew Weil for Origins Night Health Bedtime Balm, which contains lavender; $25, origins.com.)

Good to know: You don't have to stick to traditional aromatherapeutic scents -- any fragrance that makes you feel good can be calming, says Dr. Phyllis Zee, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of neurology and the director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Northwestern University, in Chicago.

RealSimple.com: Get a good night's sleep

Valerian tea

Try it: If you are getting a full night's sleep but still feel tired in the a.m.

How to use it: Sip a brew made from the flowering plant an hour or so before bedtime. (Try the Republic of Tea Get Some Zzz's; $10.50 for 36 bags, republicoftea.com.) Some studies have shown that valerian can help increase sleep quality (it's packed with antioxidants, too). You may have to drink it for several nights in a row before it works, says Naiman.

Good to know: Valerian shouldn't be taken for more than two weeks at a time, since prolonged use can lead to dependency. And it can interfere with some prescription medications, including cholesterol drugs, so check with your doctor before steeping.

RealSimple.com: The best teas

GABA-enhanced drink

Try it: When your head is racing with worries.

How to use it: Down a shot of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) right before bed. (Try Arizona P.M. Relax FastShot; $3, drinkarizona.com for stores.) ""GABA, an amino acid found in your body, has been shown to quiet the mind when taken orally,"" says Naiman.

Good to know: Certain foods, including brown rice, bananas, and mackerel, contain GABA. Consuming them during the day may help you sleep better at night.

RealSimple.com: Easy ways to unwind

Melatonin supplement

Try it: If you don't feel tired until way past bedtime.

How to use it: Take a three-milligram tablet 15 to 20 minutes before bed. (Try GNC Melatonin 3; $5 for 60 tablets, gnc.com.) Your brain makes this neurohormone naturally to ""tell the body that it's time for sleep,"" says Naiman. ""But many people have suppressed melatonin production because they're overexposed to light in the evening."" Naiman has been using it nightly for 20 years.

Good to know: Consult with your doctor before taking melatonin. It is not recommended for pregnant women, women trying to conceive, children, and adolescent boys (it can affect testosterone levels in maturing males).

RealSimple.com: How to solve 9 sleep problems

Over-the-counter sleeping pill

Try it: When you're going through a short period of sleeplessness, like during a stressful time at work.

How to use it: At bedtime, take two tablets that contain diphenhydramine, an antihistamine that makes you feel sleepy (research shows that an excess of histamine in the body may cause insomnia). ""The less often you take these pills, the better,"" says Dr. Lisa Shives, M.D., a sleep specialist in Evanston, Illinois. ""You can build up a tolerance, and then they won't work as well."" (Try Unisom SleepGels; $10 for 32 gel tabs, at drugstores.) Note: Never mix alcohol and sleeping pills.

Good to know: ""The older you are, the slower you metabolize this type of drug,"" says Shives. That means you may experience lingering sleepiness in the morning.

RealSimple.com: What are your strategies for a longer, deeper sleep?

Prescription medication

Try it: When insomnia becomes a chronic problem.

How to use it: Work with your doctor to figure out which medication is best for you. Shives's favorite is Rozerem (rozerem.com). It acts on the melatonin receptors in the brain that help you fall and stay asleep (other aids act only as a sedative). Take a tablet about 30 minutes before bed.

Good to know: Finding the right medication may require trial and error: Some can make you more wired and awake. Side effects are common, says Shives, and range from the annoying (headaches, grogginess) to the serious, like unconscious nighttime binge eating and driving. Pregnant women may want to avoid these aids, even though they have not been proven to be dangerous.

Transcript

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.

CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Old McDonald had a farm. And if you could text about that fast enough, you might have won 50 grand! Today, you'll meet the teenager who did. I'm Carl Azuz. Welcome to CNN Student News!

First Up: U.N. General Assembly

AZUZ: First up, leaders from around the world are coming together for a meeting in New York City. It's the United Nations General Assembly, and it gets together every year. The group is going to talk about world issues; different leaders will make speeches. President Obama is scheduled to address the assembly today.

So what? Why does it matter that a bunch of leaders are having a meeting? Well, the United Nations General Assembly is made up of 192 countries. And when we say they're talking about world issues, we mean big subjects, like poverty and security, and specific things, like the war in Afghanistan or Iran's nuclear program. They can't create new laws. But the decisions that they make and the policies that they come up with can have a big influence on what goes on in the world.

Health Care Provisions

AZUZ: In the health care reform bill that you see President Obama signing over my shoulder here, that might've been his biggest victory of his first two years in office. And parts of that law go into effect this week. For example, you can stay on your parents' health insurance until you're 26, and insurance companies can't turn down children with medical conditions that exist at the time they apply for insurance. Some people were and still are against this law, though. For one thing, it can cost a lot of money. Plus, critics don't like the idea that people have to get health insurance. That part of the bill goes into effect in a few years.

What's the Word?

TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: What's the word?

the sector of a country's economy that isn't run by its government

PRIVATE SECTOR

That's the word!

Cuban Economy

AZUZ: Running a business in the private sector means risks and rewards. You can set your own prices, but there's no one to really fall back on if things don't go so well. Shasta Darlington looks at what's in store for thousands of Cubans who are about to lose their government jobs and make the shift into the private sector.

(BEGIN VIDEO)

SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT, HAVANA: A tall order in communist Cuba: finding jobs for half a million laid-off workers in the private sector. Here in Old Havana, not everyone is celebrating this capitalist notion. Like it or not, employees at this barbershop around the corner are being pushed off the state payroll and handed the shop. They'll be able to set prices and keep earnings, but they'll now have to pay taxes and rent, and there's no longer the guarantee of a fixed income.

GERARDO, HAVANA BARBER [TRANSLATED]: ""I've been working for the state for years now and I'm not interested in going private,"" says Gerardo. ""I want to keep working for the state.""

DARLINGTON: Cuba plans to shed ten percent of public sector jobs over the next six months and allow more private enterprise to absorb the unemployed. A dramatic attempt by President Raul Castro to reshape the sputtering economy. He says the state simply can't afford a bloated and unproductive workforce. But don't expect American-style big business. Cuba's new entrepreneurs will be encouraged to start small operations, maybe driving taxis, laying bricks or perhaps repairing toys. Now, to get an idea of what's in store for them, we're talking to some of the people already working in the country's miniscule private sector.

Emilio Mendoza was laid off during Cuba's last major economic crisis in the '90s. He bought a government license and set up a cobbler's shop in his driveway. He says Cubans should see this as an opportunity. Isidro, a taxi driver, says it depends on how much the state charges its new entrepreneurs in taxes and licensing fees. They all agree, the days of getting paid by the government, whether you work or lounge about, are over.

Still, the state controls about 90 percent of the economy. These modest proposals aren't likely to radically shift that balance, but they will give life to a new class of small businesses that could change the face of Cuba.

Shoutout

STAN CASE, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Which one of these is the flag of Chile? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A, B, C or D?  You've got three seconds -- GO!

24 Hours in the Chilean Mine

AZUZ: The 33 men who are waiting to be rescued from a mine in Chile are experiencing things most people never will and most people hope they never will. Take something as simple as time. We can check our watches, our cell phones. They can do that too. But when we look outside, we can see the sun, we can see the moon, we can sort of estimate what time of day or night it is in some cases. They can't do that. Karl Penhaul shows us a day in the life when you are trapped underground.

(BEGIN VIDEO)

KARL PENHAUL, CNN CORRESPONDENT, CHILE: A new dawn breaks. 33 miners face another day trapped half a mile deep. Rescue workers say the men never lost their notion of time.

MIGUEL FORTT, CHILE RESCUE COORDINATOR [TRANSLATED]: The miners have cell phones, so they had a calendar. They knew perfectly what day it was and what time it was. The only thing they didn't know was what the weather was like.

PENHAUL: It's 8 a.m. on the surface. Far underground, day shift is starting. They're working to help rescue themselves.

FORTT [TRANSLATED]: They have eight hours of rest, another eight-hour work shift, and eight hours to play games, read, write letters, jog or have a walk, because they have access to about 2.5 km of tunnels.

PENHAUL: Time is marked by meals sent down in metal tubes rescuers call carrier pigeons. Nurse Mabel Rios is supervising.

MABEL RIOS, NURSE [TRANSLATED]: About 7:45, we send them breakfast. At 10 a.m., a milkshake. At 12, we send them lunch. At 4 p.m., another milkshake. And around 7 p.m., we send them their dinner.

PENHAUL: First job of the day: check air quality. By midday, paramedic Yonni Barrios has checked all the miners' vital signs and sent the data to doctors above. Around the clock, miners help with the rescue effort, clearing debris from the drills now boring an escape shaft. At 4 p.m., day shift ends. Miners play games, listen to music, and work out on the orders of a personal trainer far above.

FORTT [TRANSLATED]: Because they're sitting down all day, they have a personal trainer to help them cut down their waistline so they can fit in the rescue capsule.

PENHAUL: Work or rest, the miners spend their day wandering up and down between the workshop, refuge or camp. But until the day one of the drills finally rescues them, those 33 lives must stay on hold. Karl Penhaul, CNN, at the San Jose Mine in northern Chile.

Texting Champion

AZUZ: We're not sure we have any advice for Brianna Hendrickson. At least not when it comes to texting. The 13 year old took first place in the National Texting Championship. The final challenge: type out a modified version of ""Old McDonald."" Brianna nailed it in just 60 seconds. The prize: $50,000! She won $50,000 for texting and the chance to compete again. Win that one, and she might get another 50 grand, plus get to pick a charity that'll get a $50,000 donation.

Before We Go

AZUZ: That's a lot of dough. We're cooking up a different ingredient for today's Before We Go segment: corn! You probably can't tell from this high up, but that's what this is. It's actually a corn maze. The annual Idaho attraction is opening up this week. The designer says it took him two days; he does it all by hand. Can you imagine spending two straight days out in the fields making this?

Goodbye

AZUZ: That's a guy who really gets lost in his work. We're back tomorrow. We hope you'll lend us an ear then! You'll find many kernels of knowledge! It's gonna be cobs of fun! Whoo! We could do corny puns all day but, shucks, we're out of time.
